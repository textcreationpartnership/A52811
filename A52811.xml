         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>David</hi> reflects upon Original Sin as the Original cauſe of all his

            <p>Thus <hi>Man's Malady</hi> begins betimes, even in our Conception; this ſubtile Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſowed his Tares very early, ſo that we are all
<hi>born in our ſin,</hi> Joh. 9.34. <hi>Adam begat a Son in his own Image,</hi> Gen. 5.3. and his <hi>Childrens Teeth are ſet on Edge</hi> after he had eaten the ſour Fruit of the forbidden Tree, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.2. The ſame Hand that was reached forth to that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, reached out both Sin and Death to the Fruit of his Loins wherein that Fruit was ſeminally, as the Branches are in a Common Stock; the actual Sin did not determine the bound of Miſery in himſelf, but it brought a ſecond Miſery with it, even the Miſery of the whole Nature of Mankind. <hi>Adam</hi> was the
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative</hi> or publick Perſon repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole maſs of Mankind, (as a Parliament-man repreſents the whole Country he is choſen for) while <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood, we all ſtood in him; while he kept his Obedience in his ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, he kept his whole Eſtate and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſafe and entire; but when he fell we all fell in him; in <hi>Adam all die,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. Tho' we did not chooſe him, yet God did chooſe him for us, as our <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:48866:9"/>and his Sin was the greateſt Sin (next to that <hi>Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi>) as it had many aggravations againſt the greateſt <hi>Light,</hi> and the greateſt
<hi>Love</hi> that ever was vouchſafed to any man, and therefore it was juſt with God ſo to puniſh, not only himſelf, but his whole Nature alſo for that ſinful Act. Hereby all the Sons and Daughters of
<hi>Adam</hi> came to be deprived of Original Righteouſneſs; we are all
<hi>alienated</hi> from the <hi>Life of God,</hi> Eph. 4.18. born the
<hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. and <hi>come ſhort both of God's Glory,</hi> and of our <hi>own Duty,</hi> Rom. 3.23.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> firſt defiled the Nature of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and ever ſince the defiled Nature hath defiled the whole Off-ſpring thereof, leaving them under the Curſe of God, and liable unto Death in the latitude of it, even unto <hi>Death, Temporal, Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Eternal:</hi> The Fall of
<hi>Adam</hi> was the Death of himſelf, and the Death of us; yea, and alſo it was the Death of our dear Redeemer to redeem us from Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Eternal Death. Now as is the Root, ſo are the Branches; as is the Fountain, ſo are the Waters that flow from it: [<hi>Generatum ſequitur Naturam Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantis,</hi>] that which is begotten doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Nature of that which begetteth; <hi>who can bring a clean</hi> thing out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean?

So our fleſhly luſts are thoſe <hi>Syrians</hi> and Soldiers whom <hi>Satan</hi> commands to war principally againſt the precious Soul, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is moſtly to be miſchievous to Saints more than to Sinners; for he tempted <hi>David</hi> (<hi>a man after Gods own heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 13.14.) to groſſer and greater ſins than ever he did, not only <hi>Saul,</hi> who died<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48866:19"/>in his Sin, even of ſelf-murder, yet never fell into ſuch foul acts of ſin as <hi>David</hi> did, but alſo than ever he did tempt <hi>Ahab,</hi> tho' <hi>he ſold himſelf to work wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,</hi> 1 King. 21.25. yet this <hi>none-ſuch Sinner</hi> was only tempted to covet his Neighbours Vineyard, and not his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Wife, yea and life too, as
<hi>David</hi> did. The reaſon is this, becauſe <hi>Satan</hi> is ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>evil ſtate</hi> that <hi>Sinners</hi> remain in, ſo he needs not to tempt them to <hi>evil Acts,</hi> well knowing, that ſuch Actions will as naturally flow from them, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth from a Fountain: Thus <hi>David</hi> ſaith to <hi>Saul</hi> [<hi>wickedneſs proceedeth</hi> (even naturally) <hi>from</hi> the <hi>wicked</hi>] 1 Sam.
24.13. as if they needed no Tempter, but will Tempt themſelves, <hi>Jam.</hi>
1.14,15. <hi>Satan</hi> matters not for <hi>Actions,</hi> but only where he cannot ſecure perſons and ſtill keep them captive in an evil <hi>State. NB.</hi> This Reaſon may be rendred, why ſome <hi>civil Moraliſts</hi> do lead more blameleſs and more ſpotleſs lives, than ſome Saints and ſanctified Souls, (who ſometimes may be left of God to <hi>Satan</hi>'s buffeting Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to humble them, as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7,8.) becauſe
'tis enough for the Temper to know that theſe meer <hi>moral men</hi> do ſtill abide in a <hi>Chriſtleſs-ſtate,</hi> but as to ſuch as are
<hi>delivered from the power of Belial,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:48866:20"/>and are
<hi>tranſlated into</hi> the <hi>Kingdom of Grace,</hi> Col. 1.12,13,14. Thoſe be they againſt whom this <hi>Envious One</hi> is moſt maliciouſly miſchievous, and when he ſees that he cannot keep them from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he will do them all the miſchief he poſſibly can; he will ſend them (if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) even haulting to Heaven. Herein <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (that
<hi>Dragon of Egypt,</hi> ſo called, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 29.3. was a <hi>Type</hi> and Figure of this old Red Dragon the <hi>Devil,</hi> who was calm and quiet enough with <hi>God's Iſrael,</hi> while he found they could be content to be his Bond-ſlaves in <hi>Mortar-Work,</hi> &amp;c. but when they begin to be gone out of his Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then he rages and purſues them with his Chariots and Horſemen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued
<hi>Iſrael</hi> as they were paſſing towards the <hi>Earthly Canaan,</hi> ſo Satan purſueth us in our paſſage towards the <hi>Heavenly Canaan;</hi> and as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his purſuit of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was at length drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Red-Sea:</hi> So this may be for ſtrong Conſolation to us, that this Saint-purſuing <hi>Satan</hi> ſhall at laſt be drowned in the <hi>Red-Sea</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour's Blood; for we are told to our Comfort, that our <hi>Redeeming Angel will come down from Heaven, having the Key of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs Pit,</hi> and a <hi>great Chain in his hand,</hi> and <hi>will lay hold</hi> on the <hi>Dragon, that old
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48866:20"/>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and not only <hi>bind him</hi> for a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> but he will <hi>caſt him</hi> likewiſe into the <hi>lake of Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimſtone,</hi> where
<hi>he</hi> (together with the <hi>Beaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Falſe Prophet</hi>) ſhall be <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented day and night for ever and ever,</hi> Rev. 20.1,2,3, and 10, verſes. In the mean time we muſt expect, that this
<hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> and <hi>Dragon</hi> will be ſpetting forth the Poiſon of his Malice againſt us; for ſuch is his Malice to all the Saints, that he will firſt tempt them to Sin, and then he will accuſe them for Sin; as it is ſtoried of the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> they are ſo malicious one againſt another, that ſometimes a man will hide ſome of his own Goods in the Houſe of him whom he hateth, and then accuſe him for the ſtealing of them; juſt ſo doth the Devil deal many times with God's deareſt Servants; thus <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard firſt foiſted his Lord's Cup into
<hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>'s Sack, and then accuſed him for ſtealing it,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 44.2,4. So that tempted Souls may ſay to Satan, (when he would tempt them to ſin, and after will accuſe them of ſin) as the young Soldier ſaid to <hi>Joab</hi> his General, [<hi>Tho' I ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thouſand Shekels of Silver,</hi> yet <hi>will I not dare to do what thou (Satan) would draw me into,</hi> for the <hi>King of Kings hath charged</hi> me to the contrary; and<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48866:21"/>ſhould I do otherwiſe, I ſhall then <hi>work falſhood againſt my own life;</hi> for <hi>there is no matter that can be hid from the King,</hi> and thou <hi>thy ſelf would ſet thy ſelf againſt me,</hi> 2 Sam. 18.12,13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Satan</hi> dealt with <hi>Jehoſhua</hi> the High-Prieſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him for wearing thoſe very Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that himſelf had ſoiled, <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1,2,3,4. yea, and thus <hi>Satan</hi> dealt with our Dear Saviour himſelf, to whom he made an offer of his giving to him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glories of them, if he would fall down and worſhip him, <hi>Matt.</hi> 4.8. yet afterwards this <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren</hi> (as he is called
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12.10.) doth by his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments accuſe our Lord for aſpiring after one of the leaſt of thoſe Kingdoms of the World, namely, that little Kingdom of <hi>Judaea, Matt.</hi> 27.11,29,37. and this is the Tempters Method with all tempted Souls; he will always <hi>extenuate</hi> ſin in the time of his Temptation to it, but after the Commiſſion of it, he will <hi>aggravate</hi> it in his accuſation for it, that he may drive the Soul into deſpair, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he dealt with King <hi>Saul,</hi> whom he firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to ſpare <hi>Amalek,</hi> under the notion of a good Deed or Work of Mercy; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he tempted him, and prevailed to ſpare King <hi>Agag,</hi> and the <hi>fatteſt</hi> of the <hi>Flock,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48866:21"/>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.8,9. Yet this ſame <hi>Satan</hi> comes to <hi>Saul</hi> in the likeneſs of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly aggravates this Action (which before he had preſented to him in a plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Dreſs of candour and kindneſs to the Creature,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and ſets it home with weight upon <hi>Saul</hi>'s Conſcience; eſpecially when he ſaw him almoſt overwhelmed with deepeſt Diſtreſſes, now repreſenting the ſame Action as moſt horrible, heinous and damning, and all to drive him down at-once into the Pit of Deſperation, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.11,19,20. And thus by Divine per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion the Devil deals with many Souls, which are far more dear to God, than this <hi>Saul</hi> was, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereby the third curſed property of this <hi>Doeg</hi> the
<hi>Devil</hi> is made manifeſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he is not only <hi>antiently, maliciouſly,</hi> but alſo <hi>univerſally</hi> miſchievous to all Mankind, even to all Saints, and to all Sinners, at the leaſt intentionally againſt every individual perſon of both ſorts, only with this difference; as <hi>firſt</hi> for <hi>Sinners,</hi> he makes them to become his Hackney-Horſes, according to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s phraſe [<hi>Impii perſecutores inſeſſorem Diabolum habent</hi>] all wicked Perſecutors have the Devil Riding upon their backs, whom he whips and ſpurrs end-ways into an high Gallop, even all the days of their lives, and<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48866:22"/>then, when the Night of their Deaths comes upon them, he lodges them at laſt in the Hot Stables of Hell: And thus <hi>Satan</hi> made
<hi>Saul</hi> his Hackney, upon whom he ſat as his Rider, and ſpurr'd him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for many days in his perſecuting of <hi>David,</hi> and to whom he gave but this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>cold Comfort</hi> at his Death [<hi>To morrow thou ſhalt be with me,</hi> &amp;c.] 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.19,20. which indeed was no better a place to lodge his Hackney in at his Night of Death, than in the Hot Rooms of Hell-fire. But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> As to the <hi>Saints</hi> (who are not the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Vaſſals</hi> as <hi>Sinners</hi> are, but be indeed the Impropriated and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Veſſels</hi> of their dear Redeemer) <hi>Satan</hi> will do all the miſchief he can to thoſe
<hi>Vaſa ſignatu,</hi> or <hi>Sealed Veſſels,</hi> as
<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> calls them; thoſe <hi>he</hi> cannot <hi>touch</hi> with any of his Deadly Touches [<hi>Non Tactu qualitativo</hi>] as <hi>Cajetan</hi> interpreteth [<hi>The wicked one toucheth him not</hi>] 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.19. He cannot cauſe them to <hi>fall finally.</hi> The Serpent is confined to feed upon the <hi>Duſt</hi> or <hi>Dirt</hi> of the Earth (that is, the
<hi>wicked</hi>) he is not allowed to devour the <hi>Herbs</hi> of Grace, or to deſtroy any Plants on God's holy Mountain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.25. <hi>God hath ſet the godly man apart for himſelf, Pſal.</hi> 4.3. and God's charge is upon the <hi>God of this World</hi> (as the <hi>Devil</hi> is call'd,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48866:22"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. as well as upon the <hi>Kings of the Earth, to whom</hi> thoſe words were ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken [<hi>Touch not mine Anointed ones, and do my Prophets no harm</hi>] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.15. To ſay, this is ſpoken of Kings, and not to Kings, is a falſe interpretation. How far this <hi>wicked one</hi> may touch a Saint of God, and that maliciovſly and miſchievouſly; yea how far he touched our Saviour himſelf, is aboveſaid. Now the <hi>Enquiry</hi> is, ſeeing <hi>Satan</hi> is ſo
<hi>univerſally</hi> miſchievous both to <hi>Saints,</hi> as well as to
<hi>Sinners,</hi> how far <hi>Satan</hi> can force a Saint to ſin againſt God? <hi>Anſ.</hi> We have all great cauſe to bleſs the Lord our good God, that this Power of Darkneſs cannot force us to any work of Darkneſs; no, God hath left this Power of conſtraining us to ſin out of the Devil's Charter; he hath no Commiſſion to force the Will of Man; he hath indeed a
<hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading <hi>ſleight,</hi>
               </hi> but he hath not any <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing might.</hi> 'Tis true, we read [that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan provoked David to ſin againſt God</hi>] 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.1. that is, he ſo dogg'd
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> daily with his Temptation, and would never let him alone in any Reſt, until he had faſtned it upon his heart, and gained his conſent. However, the Great God had his holy hand in all this, who ſtill held this
<hi>Dog,</hi> this <hi>Doeg,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> in his Chain, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 24.1, <hi>God did,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> did alſo,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48866:23"/>but how? it was thus, God was angry with <hi>Iſrael</hi> for abuſing their Peace and Plenty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with <hi>David</hi> for his privy Pride and Creature-confidence, ſo he lets looſe his Dog the Devil upon <hi>David,</hi> and he left <hi>David</hi> to himſelf ſo, as at laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his being very long provoked unto this curioſity of numbring the People, he yielded his conſent to that <hi>Satanical ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion,</hi> which brought the <hi>Deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> upon his ſinful Subjects, like as the Dog may be ſaid to Bait the Beaſt at the Stake, while the owner of the Baſt doth ſtand by, looks on, and ſuffers his Beaſt to be Baited. This plain ſimilitude may ſerve to explain the difficulty, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand aright, that tho' it be ſaid, that <hi>God moved David,</hi> and <hi>Satan moved</hi> him likewiſe, yet theſe two phraſes are not contradictory. Terms; they are not <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,</hi> but only <hi>Diverſe,</hi> the latter being <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to the former, as all 2d Cauſes are <hi>ſubaltern,</hi> to the firſt Cauſe. But ſtill <hi>Satan</hi> is held in God's Chain, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without Divine permiſſion do the leaſt damage to the Soul of a Saint; he cannot force us to ſin, with all his moſt powerful provocations, as appeareth moſt plainly in the caſe of <hi>Job,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Satan</hi> made ſo many violent and furious Thruſts to make him <hi>curſe God to his face;</hi> yet could<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48866:23"/>he not conquer <hi>Job</hi> with all his provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but this good man comes off at laſt with flying Colours, and by the help of his God gets his Tempter trodden under his feet, as
<hi>Rom.</hi> 16.20. And tho' the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Conflict and Combat was
<hi>Satan</hi>'s, yet <hi>the End</hi> in the Conqueſt <hi>was the</hi> Lord's; as 'tis ſaid, <hi>James</hi> 5.11. This therefore may be very comfortable for us ſeriouſly to conſider, that the Tempter may ſtrike fire long enough to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if we do not meet him with Dry Tinder for his ſparks to fall upon; for it is our own Concupiſcence that carries the chiefeſt ſway; 'tis our own carnal Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wherewith we are <hi>drawn aſide</hi> and <hi>enticed,</hi> James 1.14,15. where the word is [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which ſignifies, we are caught as the ſilly Fiſh by the Fiſher-man's Bait. <hi>Satan</hi> is a crafty Fiſher, and knows what Baits will beſt tempt and take every ones Conſtitution and Humour; and tho' <hi>Satan</hi> be a Spirit, and therefore can have commerce with our Spirits, yea and may fix vain thoughts upon our fancies, yet he cannot force the Conſent of the Will thereunto; for as he cannot <hi>know the Heart,</hi> (which is only God's prerogative, <hi>Acts</hi>
1.24.) ſo he cannot compel the heart much leſs to any act of ſin, unleſs the <hi>Eve</hi> in us doth betray us into the Tempters
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48866:24"/>hands, as <hi>Adam hearkned unto the Voice of his Wife,</hi> Gen. 3,17. Thus every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> hath ſtill an <hi>Eve</hi> (his Tempter) in their own boſoms, and if <hi>Satan</hi>'s Temptation do fall paſſively only on our part upon the Tables of our hearts; it is indeed our Croſs, but not our ſin, if we conſent not to it; for 'tis our conſent to it, that makes it our ſin; as it was in the caſe of <hi>Benjamin</hi> before-ſaid; he never conſented to the putting of the Divining Cup into the mouth of his Sack; ſo it was his croſs only, but not at all his ſin: Therefore ought we in an hour of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to do theſe two great Duties.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> To <hi>give no place</hi> to the Tempter,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.27. <hi>no, not for an hour,</hi> Gal. 2.5. by <hi>way</hi> of
<hi>ſubjection.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> To <hi>reſiſt</hi> him, and he will flee from from us, <hi>James</hi> 4.7. eſpecially if we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him ſtedfaſt in the Faith,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.8,9. even with a Reſolved Negative, No, No, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> However, ſuch is <hi>Satan</hi>'s Hatred to all the
<hi>Saints,</hi> that he will be <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally</hi> miſchievous to them, and do them all the Damage and Detriment that he poſſibly can do; and as we may learn from the Story of <hi>Balaam</hi> the Southſayer (who was
<hi>Satan</hi>'s Servant, when he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not curſe the whole Camp of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> he will do his utmoſt endeavour to curſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48866:24"/>ſome part thereof, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.13,27.</p>
            <p n="4">The 4<hi>th</hi> Curſed Character and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this

'Tis ſaid of the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> that there is no minute of Time, wherein he doth not thruſt out his Sting, but he keeps it in a continual motion for a ſpeedy poiſoning of all whatſoever he can reach with it as before; even ſo this <hi>Old Serpent</hi> or
<hi>Scorpion</hi> the Devil, is reſtleſs night and day, and puts forth his poiſonful Sting without ceaſing to <hi>wound us</hi> in our <hi>Heels</hi> (according to his Commiſſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.) that thereby he may transfuſe his Venom from our Heels to our Hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And 'tis his conſtant cuſtom to Aſſault us both ſleeping and waking, for he keeps no holy day (as the Vulgar ſaying is) nor will he make any Truce, or Ceſſation of Arms with us; and he will ſet upon us, both in our
<hi>Natural,</hi> and in our <hi>Civil</hi> Actions; yea and moſt of all in thoſe that are <hi>Religious.</hi> He doth not only tempt us to exceſs in our Food and Raiment; but he will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us alſo in the Duties of our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Callings, yet higher above all we meet with moſt Diſturbances in the Duties of our general Callings; ſo that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>ſerve the Lord</hi> (either publickly or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately) <hi>without Diſtraction</hi> from this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48866:25"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.35. Neither
<hi>Week-day</hi> nor <hi>Sabbath-day;</hi> nay, upon the Sabbath (which ſignifies a Reſt) is this <hi>Satan</hi> the moſt <hi>Reſtleſs;</hi> for while we are the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt about God's Service, and the concerns of our Souls, then will he be a moſt <hi>Buſie Devil</hi> with our <hi>Baſe Hearts,</hi> to interrupt our Communion with Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This may have its Illuſtration from <hi>Drexelius</hi> his Viſion, whereof he gives us this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, [that he ſaw but <hi>one Devil</hi> at a Market upon the Week-day, but he ſaw ten Devils preſent at a Sermon upon the Sabbath-day] and being asked the reaſon of this difference of the number of Devils, the good old Man thus anſwered, That in a Market there was no need of any more than one Devil; for there one Man would tempt another faſt enough, the Buyer, the Seller, and the Seller the Buyer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but at a Sermon, where all men do ſolemnly Devote themſelves to God's Worſhip, then ten Devils were few enough to diſtract them therein. Thus we read how <hi>Satan</hi> thruſt in among the Sons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. &amp; 2.1. &amp; 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 21.10,13. As Satan ever ſince the Fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> never had Reſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43,44,45. ſo he never would have Reſt night or day, unleſs he be in a ſinner's heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p n="5">The 5<hi>th Curſed Character</hi> and Property
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48866:25"/>of this our <hi>Adverſary,</hi> is, that he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>irreſiſtibly miſchievous</hi> as to any <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Power</hi> for <hi>Reſiſting</hi> him. This is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated before, how the Innocenteſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> the ſtrongeſt Man <hi>Samſon,</hi> and the wiſeſt Man <hi>Solomon,</hi> were none of them able to reſiſt the Aſſaults of this <hi>ſtrong Man Armed;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe his <hi>Angelical</hi> (tho' now <hi>Diabolical</hi>) <hi>Nature</hi> is too ſtrong for any mere <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> we are all as unable to withſtand him, (1.) As the <hi>feeble Flye</hi> is the <hi>cunning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which moſt eaſily entangles her in his clammy Threads (ſpun out of his own bowels) whoſe firſt work is to intoxicate her (as ſoon as entangled) by infuſing his poiſon into her head, and then with more eaſe he draws her into his Den, and there he ſucks out her blood and her life both together. Nor are we poor Mortals more able to reſiſt this <hi>Strong Man Armed,</hi> than (2.) The <hi>ſilly Dove</hi> is to withſtand the furious Aſſaults of the <hi>ſtrong Eagle,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Behold here, how our moſt Gracious Father in Heaven provides and prepares a moſt Sovereign <hi>Plaiſter</hi> (made up of the warm Blood of our Bleſſed and Bleeding <hi>Redeemer,</hi> who was the <hi>Lamb ſlain</hi> from the <hi>Foundation of the World,</hi> Revel. 13.8.) So ſoon as the <hi>Strong Man armed</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this mortal Wound to the Root of Mankind, even to Innocent <hi>Adam</hi> in his Paradiſe-Eſtate, and this
<hi>Goſpel of Peace</hi> our good God himſelf did preach thus early, that none of the Spirits of his dear Children (though corrupted by the faln Nature) might ſink in them. N.B. <hi>Note well, Goſpel,</hi> quaſi <hi>God's Spell,</hi> as if it were a Divine Spell of God's own ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherewith to catch that <hi>Old Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> the good Lord teaches us to <hi>ſpell</hi> out the Glad Tidings out of this<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48866:30"/>
               <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel.</hi> [<hi>When Men are caſt down, then ſhalt thou ſay,</hi> there is a <hi>lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up,</hi> Job 22.29.] As the deſign of the firſt Chapter in this little Book was to <hi>caſt down,</hi> and to humble us miſerable Mortals under the ſaving Senſe of
<hi>Man's Malady</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> by the fall of the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> by the deceitfulneſs of the Devil; and oh that many more of us were ſo ſenſibly caſt down and duly humbled. Accordingly the Drift and Scope of this <hi>Second Chapter,</hi> is for a ſeaſonable <hi>lifting up</hi> of ſuch humble Souls with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi> of the
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> by repreſenting the true and only <hi>Remedy</hi> againſt this match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Malady,</hi> to wit, our dear Redeemer. And to the ſame purpoſe is the purport of many Goſpel Parables, as thoſe
<hi>Three</hi> of the <hi>loſt Sheep,</hi> the <hi>loſt Groat,</hi> and the
<hi>loſt Son,</hi> from the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of all which, I have opened (through Grace) the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> in my <hi>Fourth Volume,</hi> upon

<hi>Parable</hi> in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.21,22. hath the ſame tendency, holding forth to us, that though our <hi>Malady be ſtrong,</hi> yet our
<hi>Remedy</hi> is <hi>ſtronger;</hi> that our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> is
<hi>ſtronger</hi> to <hi>Save</hi> us, than <hi>Satan</hi> is to

<hi>ſpecial Object</hi> of their proud Motion at the firſt in them? There be <hi>Three</hi> differing Opinions: The <hi>Firſt</hi> is, That

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>Third Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> is, That he preſumed to have the Honour of the <hi>Hypoſtatical Union,</hi> which appertained only to the
<hi>Second Perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> namely, to the <hi>Son of God.</hi> The ground of this Opinion is, (as ſome ſay) That preſently after the Creation of Angels, the Creator did reveal this his purpoſe of making a <hi>certain Man,</hi> to whom the Second Perſon in the Godhead muſt be united, and that all the Angels muſt Worſhip this
<hi>God-man,</hi> as the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World; no ſooner did the

<hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Reſpect,</hi> both in <hi>Heaven</hi> and upon <hi>Earth,</hi> both in his <hi>Perſon</hi> and in his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp;c.</hi> that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>ſtronger Man,</hi> and too ſtrong for this
<hi>ſtrong Man, Satan,</hi> tho' he be <hi>armed</hi> Cap-a-pee from head to foot. Now I come to the <hi>Second Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi> to ſhew the
<hi>Reaſon</hi> why it muſt be ſo.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, The <hi>Creator</hi> muſt be too ſtrong for the Creature: Now that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Devil's Creator, appeareth by many Scriptures; as by <hi>John</hi> 1.3. and by
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. and by <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2,3. All which places do declare the
<hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for none can have a Creating-power, ſave only the Omnipotent God, who can bring all things out of nothing: Now all things, whether <hi>Viſible</hi> or <hi>Inviſible,</hi> whether they be
<hi>Thrones,</hi> or <hi>Dominions,</hi> or <hi>Principalities,</hi> (which is one of <hi>Satan</hi>'s names, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.12.) or <hi>Powers;</hi> all
<hi>things</hi> were <hi>created</hi> not only <hi>by</hi> him, but alſo
<hi>for him,</hi> Col. 1.16. and if ſo, it muſt follow, that the
<hi>Devil</hi> is one of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Creatures, and not only made by him,<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48866:36"/>but alſo <hi>for him,</hi> that is, for accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ends of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Glorious Will, or as it is expreſſed, [all were <hi>created</hi> for the <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>] <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.11. Now ſhould the Devil be too ſtrong for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> this could not be Chriſt's <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> but his Pain and Torment to be <hi>maſtered</hi> by another, and brought into Subjection, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This the Adverſary himſelf doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in his ſaying to Chriſt, [<hi>Art thou come to Torment us before the time?</hi>] Mat. 8.29. wherein he owned not only that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was over-powerful for him, but alſo that to be over-powered, and to be diſpoſſeſſed too, could not be accounted any pleaſure to him, but his great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be <hi>caſt out</hi> of his <hi>Palace,</hi> and to loſe the place of his pleaſure. Thus it may eaſily be concluded, that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be ſtronger than his <hi>Creature,</hi> otherwiſe the Creature would not be for his <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;</hi> it muſt be
<hi>Pain</hi> for a <hi>Superior</hi> to be ſubdued by an <hi>Inferior:</hi> A noble Prince by a baſe Peaſant, a Priſoner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon, why <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt be ſtronger than <hi>Satan,</hi> is, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is likewiſe the
<hi>Upholder</hi> of all created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; 'tis ſaid, [<hi>Chriſt upholdeth all things</hi> by the <hi>Word of his Power,</hi> Hebr. 1.3. As 'tis ſaid,
[The <hi>Father made the Worlds by his Son</hi>] ver. 2. and [<hi>without him nothing<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48866:36"/>was made that was created</hi>] John 1.3. The Son of God was not idle, or uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the firſt Creation, but was a
<hi>Co-Agent</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> in that Almighty Work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So here he is brought in as an <hi>upholder of all things</hi> by the Word of his Power, in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Works of his
<hi>Providence;</hi> and he <hi>upholds</hi> all created Things, both
<hi>Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum ſuum eſſe, &amp; ſecundum ſuum ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rari,</hi> (as the Schoolmen's Phraſe is) that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> upholds all things, both as to their Beings and Eſſence, and as to their Actings and Operations. So that the Fire cannot burn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> without the Divine Concourſe of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as both in the Caſe of <hi>Moſes Buſh</hi> which
<hi>burned,</hi> but was not <hi>conſumed, Exod.</hi> 3.2. And in the Caſe of thoſe three <hi>Nobles of Babylon,</hi> who were caſt into the exceeding
<hi>hot fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> but the Fire had no power over their Bodies, nor was <hi>one Hair of their Head ſinged,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.23,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> How came this to paſs? We are told there, that the <hi>Son of God</hi> made the <hi>fourth Man</hi> among them, and reſtrained the fury of thoſe Flames, ſo that not any <hi>ſmell of burning</hi> was <hi>upon them,</hi> Ver. 24, 25, 26, 27. Where we are told how <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> heard the <hi>three</hi> Men praiſing God in the Fire, (as the Septuagint ſaith there)<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48866:37"/>and he ſaw the <hi>fourth</hi> as their Redeemer. All which do clearly declare, That the <hi>Devil</hi> (but a Creature) is upheld by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> both in his Being, and in his Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: He could not harm an Hog without asking leave from his Lord, [ſuffer us to go, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 8.30,31,32.] much leſs any <hi>Lamb of Chriſt,</hi> who lends him his leave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the
<hi>Borrowing-power</hi> can never be <hi>too ſtrong</hi> for the
<hi>Lending-power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

72.6. <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48866:38"/>'Tis ſaid [<hi>the Spirit of God did move upon the face of the firſt deformed Chaos,</hi> and Gen. 1.2. and thereby brought forth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually a Beautiful World: So no better are our Hearts and Habits, until the Spirit deſcends as a <hi>Dove</hi> upon us, and <hi>give more grace,</hi> James 4.6.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Chriſt</hi> the ſtrong Redeemer cauſeth his Redeemed Ones to be Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours alſo in <hi>Reſiſting Temptations;</hi> for he having before hand broken the <hi>Serpent's Head,</hi> Gen. 3.15. doth only leave <hi>Tail-Temptations</hi> for the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of their
<hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and not for the deſtruction of their Souls. He hath engaged his own Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Fidelity for aſſuring us of this great Truth, in that truly Golden Promiſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. where he ſaith [That

<hi>Reſiſts us,</hi> Zech. 3.1,2,3, &amp;c. which he can eaſily do, as having him in a Chain; and 'tis but taking up a Link or two there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, then our Souls are ſafe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He makes them Conquerours in <hi>mortifying Corruptions;</hi> from which none (even thoſe of the higheſt Form) are not exempted; <hi>Elijah, Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>like paſſions</hi> with others, <hi>Acts</hi> 14.15. and
<hi>James</hi> 5.17.

Our <hi>Graces</hi> (like the <hi>Army of Iſrael</hi>) are very ſmall, when our <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> like the <hi>Syrians,</hi> are ſo numerous as to fill the whole Country of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> 1 Kings 20.27. therefore is it ſaid,<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48866:40"/>that the <hi>Righteous are ſcarcely ſaved,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.18. that is, they have much ado, and meet with many difficulties before they can reach to Heaven; and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, [He that <hi>truſts his own heart is a fool</hi>] Prov. 28.26.

<hi>will do what he hath ſaid,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.25. 1 Kings 8.15. And, which is more than all this, God ſometimes doth give <hi>pardoning Mercy,</hi> where he hath denyed <hi>prevailing Grace;</hi> as this latter hath been withdrawn to
<hi>humble</hi> the Saints; ſo the former is granted to <hi>comfort</hi> them, as in that double caſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter;</hi> but then there muſt be ſome proportion<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48866:40"/>betwixt <hi>ſinning</hi> and <hi>ſorrowing; Manaſſeh</hi> had <hi>greatly ſinned,</hi> and was as <hi>greatly humbled.</hi> Oh! let all bleſs the Lord for this, that

<hi>Tyrant,</hi> but never <hi>Rex</hi> or choſen King; it may come as a
<hi>Traveller,</hi> as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.4. but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an

               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The next Caſe of Difficulty, wherein the Redeemer aſſiſts the Redeemed to become Conquerors alſo, is in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Communion with God. Alas, how heavy are our Hearts,
[<hi>Leve ſurſum, grave deorſum</hi>] heavy things hang down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as light things preſs upward, which our Hearts cannot do, having the Stone in them, the <hi>Spouſe</hi> was ſenſible hereof, when ſhe prayed,

<hi>Anſelm</hi>'s <hi>Bird</hi> with a Stone tied to its foot, is a lively Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this Caſe, no ſooner did the Bird eſſay to mount up toward Heaven; but the Stone at her foot did preſently pluck her down to the Earth. It may well be ſaid, [Oh, <hi>how weak are our Hearts!</hi>] Ezek.
16.30. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith to his Diſciples [<hi>Can ye not watch with me one Hour,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> indeed is <hi>willing,</hi> but the
<hi>Fleſh</hi> is <hi>weak</hi>] Matth. 26.41. As if our Lord had ſaid with the kindeſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48866:41"/>to them, ſeeing I find
<hi>willingneſs of Spirit</hi> (ſo far as you are <hi>renewed in the Inner-man</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi>) I will either ſtrengthen you againſt the <hi>weakneſs of the Fleſh,</hi> or I will pardon it; and not only ſo, but I will accept of your <hi>willingneſs</hi> to Watch and Pray, wherein your unrenewed part by the Law of your Members doth diſcover ſo much weakneſs. Thus our Lord excuſeth their frailties of Fleſh, whereof he minds them, leſt they ſhould <hi>preſume,</hi> yet he moſt graciouſly owns and acknowledges the Bent of their Spirits, leſt they ſhould <hi>deſpair:</hi> The <hi>purpoſe</hi> of <hi>our Hearts</hi> muſt be to <hi>cleave unto the Lord,</hi> Acts 11.23. and becauſe we cannot duly perform it, for we cannot <hi>ſerve the Lord without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.35. Therefore we ought to pray with
<hi>David,</hi> [<hi>Lord, unite my heart to ſerve thee</hi>] Pſal. 86.11. For a looſe Heart, (that is not tied faſt to God, can never abide at the Mark, but will ſtart aſide like a deceitful Bow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.57. and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.16. Alas, never did the unruly Bullock ſtand in more need to be <hi>bound faſt with Cords to the Horns of the Altar,</hi> Pſal.
118.27. than our Hearts do to be bound faſt to God with the golden Cords of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Love in our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him. And thus our Lord ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48866:41"/>[<hi>With everlaſting kindneſs have I drawn thee</hi>] Jer. 31.3. And [<hi>I drew them with the Cords of a</hi> (or ſuitable to a) <hi>Man,</hi> even with <hi>Bands of Love</hi>] Hoſ. 11.4. Whereas God had complained of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a little before this, [<hi>that their hearts were divided</hi>] Hoſ. 10.2. becauſe <hi>Anima diſperſa fit minor;</hi> ſaith the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> when the Soul is diſperſed among various Objects, it is thereby much weakened in its Actings. Whereas on the other hand, [<hi>Vis unita eſt fortior</hi>] an <hi>Heart united</hi> and firmly <hi>fixed</hi> to God, [as <hi>David</hi>'s Phraſe is) is thereby ſo ſtrengthened, as [to <hi>cleave cloſe to the Lord,</hi> for <hi>he is our Life,</hi> and the <hi>Length of our Days</hi>] Deut. 30.20. Oh! happy are ſuch Souls that can carry on their Communion with God, be able to ſay,
[<hi>My heart is fixed</hi>] as <hi>David</hi> ſaith three ſeveral times,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7. and 108.1. and 112.7. Yea, and can drive away wandring Thoughts in the Worſhip of God, as <hi>Abraham</hi> drove <hi>away</hi> the
<hi>Fowls</hi> which did diſturb him in his ſacrificing Work, <hi>Gen.</hi>
15.11. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can anſwer diſtracting Fancies, as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did his Adverſaries, [<hi>I am about a great Work, and cannot attend you, why ſhould God's Work ceaſe, whilſt I leave it, and come down to you</hi>] Neh. 6.3. 'Tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that <hi>Honey</hi> while it is boiling hot,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48866:42"/>will not be blown upon by any filthy Flies; nor would our Hearts be fly-blown by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the Prince of Flies, (as the Name ſignifies). If we could but keep them in a fervent Frame, <hi>enditing good Matter,</hi> as <hi>David did his heart,</hi> Pſal. 45.1. Hebr. Margent, God commands us to be <hi>fervent</hi> in Spirit, <hi>ſerving the Lord,</hi> Rom.
12.11. or we cannot keep in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God; but neither this Work, nor any other can we do by any ſtrength of our own, yet may we be able to do all the Works of a Chriſtian through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>ſtronger Man</hi>)<hi> that ſtrengthens us,</hi> Phil. 4.13.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh</hi> and laſt Caſe of Difficulty in which the
<hi>Redeemer ſtrengthens</hi> his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> with a conquering Power, is in making their <hi>Paſſage forward,</hi> and their <hi>Progreſs perfect</hi> through the wayleſs and waterleſs Wilderneſs of this preſent <hi>evil</hi> World, (ſo called, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4.) even into the

Though there be a <hi>Red-Sea</hi> before, and an <hi>Enemy</hi> behind, and <hi>mighty Mountains</hi> round about; yet was there no cauſe of fear, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the

<hi>Ephraim</hi> by the <hi>Arms,</hi> &amp;c.

Thus our Lord is ſaid, [to <hi>guide our feet in the way of Peace</hi>] Luke
1.79.

            <p>The Second <hi>Enquiry</hi> is, What <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> doth our

<hi>Artificer,</hi> the curious Contriver, who framed and faſhioned this Spiritual Sword, the Holy Spirit hath the honour of making this excellent weapon ready to our hands; for thus we are told [That <hi>no Prophecy of Scripture</hi> came in <hi>old<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48866:54"/>Time</hi> by the <hi>will of man,</hi> but <hi>holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c.] 2 Pet. 1.20,21.

<hi>tremble</hi> at his <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.120.) God promiſeth to <hi>lend a look of Love</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 66.3.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Reaſon</hi> why the <hi>Word</hi> is called a

            <p>But the <hi>Fourth Reaſon</hi> above all is, this was the

<hi>crooked piercing</hi> Serpent, as <hi>Iſai.</hi> 27.1.

<hi>Earthquake</hi> by his fall. Even ſo our myſtical <hi>David</hi> here doth chooſe thoſe three ſmooth Stones out of the Silver Streams of the Sacred Scriptures, and with <hi>theſe,</hi> being ſlung by a Divine Art and Hand, he likewiſe knocks down the <hi>Great Goliah</hi> of <hi>Hell.</hi> All this doth teach us, that the Books of the Holy Scriptures are a bleſſed Armory, (far beyond that of <hi>Solomons,</hi> Cant. 4.4.

3.1,2,3,4,5,6. Oh, how cunning was this Tempter to begin his <hi>parlying</hi> with <hi>her</hi> who was the <hi>weaker Veſſel,</hi> which was according to that old ſaying, [<hi>where the Hedge is the loweſt,</hi> there the miſchievous Beaſt will leap over.] Alas, we do but ſhoot with
<hi>Satan</hi> in his own Bow, (wherein he can eaſily beguile us) when we attempt to puſh back our Tempter only by parlying with him. If he proved too
<hi>hard</hi> for <hi>Eve</hi> therein in her ſtate of <hi>Innocency,</hi> and to ſo <hi>green a Tree;</hi> how much more hard for us poor <hi>dry Trees,</hi> in the faln eſtate! 'Tis an aſſured great Truth, that
<hi>Satan</hi> is better <hi>believed away,</hi> and <hi>prayed away,</hi> than
<hi>parlied</hi> or <hi>argued away:</hi> Nor (2.) is it any majeſty or authority either in our awful <hi>Looks,</hi> or in our hectoring Words that will afright him away from us; the <hi>Devil</hi> is not a Dog to be ſcared away ſo, either with an angry Aſpect, or with <hi>threatning Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> ſaying, [<hi>Avaunt Satan, and Devil do thy worſt, I defie thee and all thy works.</hi>] But 2<hi>ly Poſitively,</hi> the <hi>right means</hi> we muſt reſiſt him with, is by our <hi>putting on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 13.14. and the <hi>whole Armour of God,</hi> Epheſ. 6.11,13. wherein we muſt <hi>ſtand our ground,</hi> and

            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48866:67"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> as to the <hi>right manner,</hi> we muſt not be like <hi>ſecure Laiſh,</hi> Judg. 18.27. nor like <hi>careleſs Babylon,</hi> Rev. 18.7,8. but be always upon our
<hi>watch</hi> and <hi>guard,</hi> for he comes cunningly like a <hi>ſly Serpent,</hi> with Hony in his Mouth, &amp;c. but when he leaves us, he then leaves behind him the Sting in his Tail, and departs like a bloody Lion, tearing in pieces thoſe he overcomes. Nor can we eſcape by <hi>fleeing</hi> from him, were we like <hi>Aſahel,</hi> as ſwift as a Roe, &amp;c. 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 2.18. for this <hi>great old Red Dragon,</hi> Rev. 12.3. hath
<hi>great Wings</hi> wherewith he can eaſily overtake us, and then is our greateſt danger upon a double <hi>Account</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For (1<hi>ſt</hi>) NB. <hi>Note well,</hi> Among all this
<hi>Spiritual Armour</hi> before-named, there is no part or piece thereof preſcribed for protecting the <hi>Back,</hi> which when <hi>Satan</hi> finds unarmed in his purſuit after us, he moſt eaſily pierceth us with his
<hi>fiery Darts</hi> through our bare Backs, even to our very Hearts,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the (2<hi>d</hi>) <hi>Reaſon</hi> is, we then do not only flee from the <hi>Devil,</hi> but from <hi>God</hi> too, who hath bid us
<hi>ſtand</hi> and <hi>withſtand,</hi> and hath promiſed to protect us in doing thoſe Duties: Therefore all <hi>Apoſtates</hi> and
<hi>Backſliders,</hi> who run away from under God's protection, [<hi>his Soul can have no<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48866:68"/>pleaſure in them,</hi>] Heb. 10.38. the

<hi>wo to us</hi> when <hi>God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from us,</hi> Hoſ. 9.12. then <hi>all evil comes upon us,</hi> &amp;c. It followeth then, that the Duty of
<hi>Reſiſting</hi> muſt likewiſe be done, as an additional Duty unto
<hi>Watching</hi> and <hi>Praying;</hi> and we muſt ſpend our whole lives in the <hi>work</hi> of watching, <hi>praying</hi> and <hi>reſiſting</hi> to our dying day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon thoſe few following

            <p n="1">As (1<hi>ſt</hi>) <hi>Conſider</hi> well, that the Devil is like the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth, that if men purſue him, he will flee from them, but if men flee from him, he will then purſue after them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Reaſon the Third; The very Name and Nature of
<hi>Saintſhip</hi> or <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is to be found in this Duty of
<hi>Watching;</hi> for <hi>Saints</hi> are called <hi>the Children</hi> (<hi>not of the Night,</hi> which is the proper <hi>time of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> but) <hi>of the light</hi> and of the <hi>day,</hi> which is the appointed ſeaſon for <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Walking</hi> and <hi>Working,</hi> 1 Theſ.
5.5,6,7. Such as are <hi>quickned</hi> by the <hi>Grace of Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.1. and are <hi>awaked</hi> out of the ſleep and State of ſin,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.14. never after this can <hi>ſleep</hi> the <hi>ſleep of Death,</hi> Pſal. 13.3. The <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did indeed <hi>ſleep,</hi> (when ſhe ſhould have been upon her watch) but
<hi>her heart was then awake;</hi> ſo that ſhe could tell all thoſe
<hi>Titles of Love,</hi> (<hi>verbatim</hi> word for word) that her beloved Lord had ſaluted her with, even while ſhe was in her half-ſleep; ſhe aggravates the foulneſs of her fault for her refuſing ſuch ſweet embraces of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them to her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2,4,5. And the <hi>five</hi> wiſe <hi>Virgins</hi> indeed nodded and napped a little, they
<hi>ſlumbred,</hi> but they did not ſleep, (as the <hi>five fooliſh Virgins</hi> did) for it was only by Candle-light, their <hi>Lamps were ſtill burning,</hi> and they had Oil in their <hi>Veſſels,</hi> as well as in their <hi>Lamps,</hi> Matth. 25.4,5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48866:77"/>of that Parable is, [<hi>Watch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi> for ye
<hi>know not when the Lord will come, ver.</hi> 13. Thus the choiceſt and chiefeſt Saints may ſometimes be taken napping: yet the <hi>hidden man of the heart</hi> (as the phraſe is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.) is ſtill kept awake in them, as it was with the <hi>Spouſe</hi> above.</p>
            <p>The Fourth <hi>Reaſon</hi> for our <hi>Watching</hi> is drawn from ſeveral Emblems of this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>&amp;c. Firſt</hi> the
<hi>Hare</hi> and the <hi>Lion</hi> are given by the learned Criticks as the two <hi>Hieoroglificks</hi> or Repreſentations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of true
<hi>Chriſtians,</hi> becauſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts</hi> do obſerve, that thoſe two <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals</hi> always ſleep with their Eyes wide open,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus likewiſe Secondly; The <hi>Modern Jews</hi> uſe to ſacrifice a <hi>white Cock</hi> upon <hi>New Years Day,</hi> whoſe intrails they ordain a <hi>Raven</hi> to fly away with into the Fields, and then to devour them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is another <hi>Emblem</hi> of Chriſtian Vigilancy; and in this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> there is this <hi>Myſtery,</hi> the
<hi>Cock</hi> is known to be the moſt <hi>watchful</hi> creature, and therefore the <hi>Cock crowing</hi> gives a denomination to the third part of the Night in Sacred Scripture, <hi>Evening, Midnight, Cock-crow,</hi> and
<hi>Morning,</hi>] Mar. 13.35. and ſo is a fit Reſemblance of the
<hi>watchful Chriſtian;</hi> and yet the more fit,<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48866:77"/>inſomuch as the Sacrifice muſt be a <hi>white Cock,</hi> to repreſent how <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are <hi>waſhed white</hi> in the
<hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> Rev. 7.14. And there is <hi>congruity</hi> in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of the <hi>Raven</hi> flying away with the white Cock's Intrails likewiſe; for one of the <hi>Spouſes</hi> commendable Characters of her Beloved is, [<hi>His locks are buſhy, and black as a Raven,</hi>] Cant. 5.11. Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the myſtical <hi>Raven,</hi> that flies away with the infirmities and ſins of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>watchful, white-waſhed Chriſtian,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the true <hi>Antitype</hi> of that <hi>Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Scape-goat</hi> that did <hi>carry away</hi> all the
<hi>Iniquities, Tranſgreſſions</hi> and <hi>Sins</hi> of
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> into the <hi>Land</hi> of everlaſting forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs,
<hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. They ſhall all be <hi>blotted out,</hi> Iſa. 43.25. and none of them remembred any more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.12. Now having anſwered the <hi>firſt inquiry,</hi> in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Reaſons</hi> why we ought all to be <hi>watchful ones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Inquiry</hi> is, what is this kind of
<hi>Watching</hi> which our Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to be found in?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There be three <hi>Kinds</hi> or Sorts of
<hi>Watching:</hi> The (1<hi>ſt</hi>) is that which is <hi>Corporeal Watching,</hi> or that of the <hi>Body,</hi> which is in ſome caſes highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as in thoſe <hi>Shepherds</hi> that brought tidings of
<hi>Chriſt's Birth,</hi> Luk. 2.8,9,10, &amp;c.<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48866:78"/>They were not only <hi>Vigilantes,</hi> but alſo were [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>they abode</hi> in <hi>the field, keeping watch over their Flock by Night:</hi> Tho' they had but ſorry Lodging there, yet had they a moſt Curious Canopy over their Heads, to wit, the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> or ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Firmament, moſt richly beſpangled with glittering and glorious Stars; nor was this all the bleſſing that thoſe
<hi>Bodily Watchers</hi> had, but they were near a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Bleſſing, even that Glorious Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> appeared to <hi>them</hi> only, and not to any of the <hi>great men</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. no nor to either of thoſe <hi>good men, Zechary</hi> or <hi>Simeon,</hi> &amp;c. with theſe glad Tidings of the Birth of the Worlds Redeemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore theſe Paſtors, or Shepherds, (of whom it is ſaid [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] <hi>cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diebant cuſtodias,</hi> they <hi>watched their Flocks,</hi> Luke 2.8.) may be a bleſſed Pattern for all good <hi>Paſtors,</hi> or <hi>Goſpel Miniſters,</hi> to <hi>take heed</hi> of their <hi>Miniſtry, which they have received in the Lord, that they fulfil it,</hi> Col. 4.17. The Angel
<hi>Gabriel</hi> may the ſooner appear to them; as this <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real</hi> or Bodily Watching was thus richly rewarded in thoſe watchful Shepherds; ſo the want of this firſt kind of watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſharply rebuked by our Lord Jeſus, ſaying to his ſleepy and ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſciples, [<hi>What, cannot ye</hi> watch <pb n="147" facs="tcp:48866:78"/>with me ſo much as one hour?
<hi>Matt.</hi> 26.40.</p>
            <p>The Second <hi>Sort</hi> of <hi>Watching</hi> is
<hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,</hi> as [<hi>the Wicked watcheth the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> Pſal.
37.32. of this <hi>David</hi> often complaineth, how they <hi>every day wreſted his words,</hi> Pſal. 56.5. And thus they watched our dear Lord, (of whom <hi>David</hi> was both Father and Figure, as we read [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] <hi>Mark</hi> 3.2. Theſe wicked ones lay <hi>catching</hi> and <hi>carping</hi> at his words, as the Greek word ſignifies, and that other Greek word [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] uſed in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.1. intimates that they pryed as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into Chriſt's Actions, as ever <hi>Laban</hi> did into
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s Stuff for his Teraphims, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.33,34. Thus
<hi>Saul</hi> ſent <hi>his Spies</hi> to <hi>watch David,</hi> 1 Sam. 19.11.
<hi>to kill him.</hi> Thus was it the ſad complaint of the Prophet
<hi>Jeremy</hi> [<hi>all my Familiars watched for my Halting,</hi> &amp;c.] Jer. 20.10. This is a <hi>watching</hi> that hath the <hi>Devil</hi> for its
<hi>Father,</hi> as John 8.44. begotten upon a <hi>depraved</hi> Spirit which
<hi>luſteth to envy,</hi> Jam. 4.5. as upon the <hi>Mother</hi> of it, God bleſs us from this, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the Third kind of <hi>Watching,</hi> is that which is truly
<hi>Divine</hi> and Spiritual, and which is not <hi>born of the Fleſh, but of the Spirit,</hi> John. 3.6. and therefore this third <hi>ſort</hi> is not
<hi>Carnal,</hi> much leſs Diabolical<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48866:79"/>or Deviliſh, but it is <hi>born from Heaven,</hi> and is an effectual means to help us to Heaven, if we live out our Lives, in a careful and conſcientious obedience to this great Command of our Lord Chriſt, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, [<hi>watch</hi>]
<hi>Matth.</hi> 24.42. and 26.41. <hi>Mark</hi> 13. laſt, and <hi>Luke</hi>
12.37,38,43, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Inquiry</hi> is, What is this true <hi>Chriſtian Vigilancy,</hi> or Spiritual <hi>Watching Chriſt</hi> requireth here?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is (in ſhort) <hi>Chriſtian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> vigorouſly actuated, or the actual and lively exerciſe of that Divine Wiſdom which the Lord graciouſly grants to ſuch as are
<hi>made wiſe to Salvation,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15. In thoſe, and thoſe only is found a caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous care, and a very wary watchful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to heed and obſerve all ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as our Lord and Maker biddeth to be well heeded and obſerved. The ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude runs in parallel lines betwixt the two kinds of <hi>Sleeping</hi> and <hi>Watching,</hi> both of that which is
<hi>Natural,</hi> and of that which is <hi>Spiritual:</hi> For as in natural or literal Sleep, that immortal part of man (the pretious Soul) layeth (as it were) dead and buried in an Houſe of Clay; all its noble parts and gifts ſeem then to be loſt, and <hi>Man</hi> (all the time he lies aſleep) doth differ very little either from a Beaſt<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48866:79"/>or a dead Carcaſs, which made that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous General, <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> ſay,
[<hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem inveni, talem reliqui,</hi>] when he was blamed for cruelty in killing his <hi>Centinel,</hi> whom he found <hi>ſleaping,</hi> to the hazard of the whole Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was, [<hi>I left him, but as I found him, &amp;c.</hi>] He looked upon him as one dead, while he lay aſleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when thoſe Vapors that cauſe Sleep are digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſumed by the Natural Heat of our Animal Spirits, and when thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of all our Senſes are thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, then (ſaith the Philoſopher) [<hi>Panduntur Meatus, Reditque opus Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſationis, id eſt, Vigilia, quae eſt Senſuum Actio &amp; Motus, quem Calor &amp; Spiritus (in omnia Membra effuſus) efficit;</hi>] that is, the Heat and Spirit being then defuſed into all our Members from Head to Foot, all the paſſages of our Senſes are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then we
<hi>awake</hi> from our Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Even thus it is with us in that which is called a <hi>Myſtical</hi> and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Sleeping, and awaking out of it: It was corrupt Humours that cauſed both the <hi>Spouſe,</hi> and the
<hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> to fall into a ſlumber, and thoſe Vapors do ariſe out of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> that unrenewed part in us, which do for a time obſtruct the operations of a Spiritual Life in us:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48866:80"/>But when the Spirit of Grace (which is called the
<hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Burning,</hi> Iſa. 4.4.) revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and burns up thoſe corrupt Humours in us, then is it that we awake, ariſe and go forth to ſhake our ſelves as <hi>Samſon</hi> did when the <hi>Philiſtines were upon him,</hi> Judg. 16.20. This is called our <hi>awaking unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.34. <hi>and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up from the Dead,</hi> Epheſ. 5.14. <hi>Awake, Awake, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 52.1.
<hi>and Ariſe, Shine,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 60.1.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth Inquiry</hi> is, what is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Object</hi> or <hi>Subject</hi> of this <hi>Spiritual Watching?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This <hi>Chriſtian Vigilancy</hi> is moſt highly concerned in this <hi>Watching-work,</hi> as it hath a Reſpect and Relation to a <hi>double Trinity;</hi> the firſt is a Trinity of
<hi>Friends,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> and the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> And the <hi>Second</hi> is, a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Foes,</hi> namely, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and the <hi>Devil.</hi> All theſe both <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Foes</hi> are to be duly and daily watched in our <hi>warring</hi> the <hi>good Warfare,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.18. and in
<hi>fighting the good Fight</hi> of Faith, 1 Tim. 6.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the <hi>firſt,</hi> The <hi>Trinity</hi> of Friends that muſt be watched is, 1<hi>ſt God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> muſt be watched; this Leſſon we ſhould learn from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who did ſo, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>We ſpeak that we know, and teſtifie
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48866:80"/>that we have ſeen,</hi> Joh. 3.11. and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
[<hi>The Son can do nothing of himſelf,</hi> but <hi>what he ſeeth the Father do,</hi> Joh. 5.19. and [<hi>the Father loveth his Son, and ſheweth him all thing that himſelf doth,</hi>] ver. 20. And [as I <hi>hear,</hi> I
<hi>do,</hi> not <hi>doing mine own,</hi> will, but the <hi>will of my Father who ſent me,</hi>] ver. 30. Now if <hi>Chriſt</hi> (that holy Child) watched what he ſaw and heard from the Father, by that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Unſpeakable Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how ought
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to watch likewiſe, having an <hi>Unction</hi> from the
<hi>Holy</hi> God, that <hi>teacheth all things,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.20. It is ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> [<hi>Veſhameru Miſhmereth</hi>] <hi>Cuſtodiebant Cuſtodiam,</hi> they <hi>watched</hi> the Motions of the Lord in the
<hi>Cloudy Pillar,</hi> Numb. 9.19. they kept <hi>Watch and Ward Night and Day</hi> to ſee when the Cloud would ariſe, that they might be at every hour ready for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving. Thus <hi>David ſet God always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,</hi> Pſal. 16.8. So ought we to do that we may learn to <hi>be holy</hi> as <hi>he is holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. Children ſhould learn to be like their Father,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. laſt, in the <hi>Quality</hi> of Holineſs, tho' we cannot come up to an <hi>Equality</hi> of his Holineſs. Thus we ought to paſs more and more into the likeneſs of that Heavenly Pattern. If our
<hi>Eyes wait upon the Lord,</hi> as the <hi>Eyes</hi> of a<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48866:81"/>Servant upon his Maſter, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 123.1,2. then is there Hope concerning both our <hi>Conformity</hi> to God, and our
<hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with God: We ought to watch <hi>God's Pillar</hi> of
<hi>Providence,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did the <hi>Cloudy Pillar;</hi> for there is God's Voice in the work of his Providence: Were we but <hi>Men of Wiſdom,</hi> to <hi>watch, hear</hi> and undeſtand it aright, <hi>Mic.</hi>
6.9. we ſhould learn the ſooner to follow Providence the better; the neglect whereof doth oft bring damage and detriment to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But tho' God's <hi>Providence</hi> may be too dark and deep for our dim Eyes to ſee, and for our dull Ears to hear; yet bleſſed be God, his
<hi>Precepts</hi> and his <hi>Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> are all ſo plain, that he who runs may read and hear them; and our not watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, makes us neglect Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>The (2<hi>d</hi>) <hi>Friend</hi> is <hi>God the Son</hi> muſt be <hi>watched,</hi> for we know not either the <hi>Day</hi> or the
<hi>Hour</hi> wherein he will call us either to Death, or to the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; every Man's Death-day is his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dooms-day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before, and becauſe we cannot foreſee it, therefore muſt we ever expect it, and ſpend every day as if it were our laſt day. Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we are all commanded to be always upon our <hi>watch,</hi> and to <hi>be alſo ready for his coming,</hi> Matth. 24.42,44. where our<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48866:81"/>Lord uſeth <hi>ſeven Argument</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 37. to the end of that Chapter, as ſo many motives to ſtir us up unto <hi>watchfulneſs;</hi> the
<hi>day and hour knoweth no man,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 36. <hi>ideo latet unus dies, ut obſerven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur omnes,</hi> that we might watch continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that
<hi>uncertain certain day.</hi> The Harlot grew bold to ſin on this account, becauſe ſhe knew her Lord would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till ſuch an appointed time,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 7.10,18,19,20. Whereas ſecure Sinners may hear, [<hi>Thou Fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be taken from thee,</hi> Luke 12.20. He
<hi>will come unlooked for,</hi> and <hi>Dichotomize, cut aſunder,</hi> and tear his Soul from his Body by force, <hi>&amp;c. Matth.</hi> 24.50,51. 'Tis a bleſſed <hi>Badge,</hi> pinn'd (as it were) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſanctified Souls Sleeves, that <hi>they wait for the coming of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor.
1.2,7. 1 Theſ. 1.10. as it was the <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of Old Teſtament Saints, that they <hi>waited</hi> for <hi>the conſolation of Iſrael</hi> in
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s firſt coming, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25. how much more ought we to lift up our Heads and Eyes for beholding the comfort of his ſecond coming,
<hi>Luke</hi> 21.28. <hi>looking for, and haſtning unto it,</hi> (as deſirous to meet him in the way,) 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.12. crying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually,

<hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6,7. and <hi>Simeon</hi> was <hi>led by the Spirit into the Temple,</hi> Luke 2.27. Yea, and our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> himſelf was <hi>led up by the Spirit</hi> into the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> to conquer<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48866:83"/>the <hi>Tempter</hi> in a <hi>Duel</hi> upon the Devil's own ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.1. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (that

<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. for he put himſelf as a Child into his Father's hand who called him, and the conduct of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> carried him dry-ſhod to the laſt. Thus likewiſe if we be the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of

We ſhould lay our ſelves (as Inſtruments) open to the <hi>Touchings</hi> of this Holy Spirit, and ſubmit to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, (which requires much ſelf-denial,) then ſhall we bring forth the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22,23. which is in <hi>all Goodneſs</hi> and
<hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> Epheſ. 5.9. And could we but
<hi>watch</hi> its whiſperings more and better, ſo as to obey them, we ſhould not ſo oft be found in <hi>Fundo Diaboli,</hi> upon the Devil's ground in places of Temptation; but as the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> ſuffered not
<hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. to go unto ſuch and ſuch Places, <hi>Acts</hi>
16.6,7. even ſo would it be with us, could we but put our Souls wholly under the conduct of this Holy Spirit. If once we dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48866:83"/>to break this Divine Hedge, that <hi>Old Serpent will ſurely bite us,</hi> Eccleſ. 10.8. We may not <hi>live</hi> at Random, and without a Rule, but we muſt mind and watch the Teachings of this <hi>Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which never teacheth us any thing, but what is conſonant to the <hi>Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> endited by it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19,20,21.</p>
            <p>Now come we to the <hi>Second Trinity,</hi> or three ſorts of
<hi>Foes</hi> or <hi>Enemies</hi> to be <hi>duly</hi> and <hi>daily watched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt Foe</hi> is the <hi>World,</hi> which is a
<hi>woful Witch,</hi> and muſt be burned for a <hi>Witch</hi> at the Laſt Day, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7,10. and therefore ought we to watch this Witch well, that we may not be bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. It is well known that ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as are bewitched, do not only loſe their Likeneſs and Beauty, but alſo do ſuffer many ſad Paroxyſms and Fits of ſtrange Diſtempers,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> As all this holds true <hi>literally</hi> to <hi>bewitched Bodies,</hi> &amp;c. ſo no leſs is it true <hi>myſtically</hi> to
<hi>bewitched Souls,</hi> which are captivated by the two fair Breaſts, (or rather Botches;) this Witch the World expoſeth to their view, namely,
<hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Profit:</hi> Such have horrible Fits of Madneſs, as <hi>Saul</hi> had, when the <hi>Evil Spirit came upon him.</hi> 1 Sam.
16.14,23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch have <hi>Leanneſs ſent into their Souls.</hi> Pſal. 106.15.<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48866:84"/>Beſides the World muſt be well watched, becauſe it is ſuch an <hi>Enemy</hi> as continually beſiegeth us, and we cannot flee from it while we live in it; therefore we muſt be ſure to have a Lid or Covering for our Hearts: Thoſe
<hi>Veſſels</hi> that wanted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, the Law doomed them Unclean,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 19.15. and ſo are our Hearts without a <hi>Covering of the Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 30.1. The Dirt of a dirty World will unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be often falling into an open unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered Heart, whereby both <hi>Mind</hi> and
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience are defiled,</hi> Tit. 1.15. We ſhould keep the World
<hi>under our Feet,</hi> where God placed it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6. and <hi>not ſet it in our Hearts,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.11.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Foe</hi> to be <hi>watched</hi> is <hi>Satan,</hi> who is called [<hi>the God of this World,</hi>] 2 Cor. 4.4. and dealeth with
<hi>Worldlings,</hi> as unlucky Boys do with ſilly Horſes; they firſt catch them with a little Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vender, and then backs them, whips and ſpurs them into an High Gallop, and rides them till they be tired, and at laſt lodges them in the Stable at night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We are told how <hi>Satan conſidered Job,</hi> and better <hi>conſidered him,</hi> Job 1.8. and 2.3. that is, he <hi>watched</hi> all Advantages to Tempt that <hi>none-ſuch Saint,</hi> and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh then, how much more ought ſuch weak worms (as we<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48866:84"/>are to <hi>conſider him,</hi> who ſo much <hi>conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<hi>Abundance of evil Thoughts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>proceed from the Heart,</hi> Matth. 15.18,19,20. The Tempter can only knock at the Door, he can neither Fire it, nor Force it open; 'tis his gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our conſent, that lets down the

               <hi>Remark</hi> the Second; As
<hi>Chriſt's Face</hi> is comely to the <hi>Eyes</hi> of gracious Souls,
[<hi>White and Ruddy,</hi> Cant. 5.10. yea, and <hi>altogether Lovely</hi> (as well as <hi>all aſunder,</hi>) ver. 11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 16. So
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Voice is comfortable to their <hi>Ears:</hi> Oh how the very hearing of it put the Spouſe into a <hi>Tranſport,</hi> having a preſent ſenſe of her Lord's approaching to make ſome gracious diſcoveries of himſelf to her by his Voice. Oh how wonderfully
<hi>refreſhing,</hi> yea <hi>raviſhing</hi> was it to this Love-ſick Spouſe, and 'tis no leſs to Love-ſick Souls. And</p>
            <p n="3">The (3<hi>d</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> is, among all the <hi>five Senſes,</hi> the Senſe of Hearing hath this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Excellency, that God hath ordained the great grace of <hi>Faith muſt come by bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Rom. 10.17. As Satan had made Man's Ear the inſtrument of Man's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, when our firſt Parents liſtned ſooner to the Tempters <hi>baſe Lies</hi> (who was a <hi>Liar</hi> from the
<hi>beginning,</hi> Joh. 8.44.) than to the <hi>bleſſed Truths</hi> of the God of Truth; even ſo our Gracious Father hath made the ſame ſenſe of hearing to be the <hi>Organ of Man's Salvation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">The (4<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remarke</hi> is, There is a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deafneſs in faln mankind: 'Tis not not ſo much <hi>God's Silence,</hi> as it is our <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> for [<hi>God ſpeaks once and twice,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48866:88"/>and <hi>Man perceiveth it not,</hi>] Job 33.14. or it may be our <hi>Childiſhneſs,</hi> as it was in the young Child <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtook God's call for old <hi>Ely</hi>'s, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
3.4,6,8,10. 'Tis worſt of all to be like the <hi>Deaf Adder,</hi> that
<hi>will not hearken,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 58.4,5. This is our caſe, until
<hi>Chriſt</hi> come and cry [<hi>Ephphatha J Ears be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> Mark
7.34,35.</p>
            <p n="5">The (5<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> is, It is a ſad diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to lie any long time under Divine Deſertions, and not to
<hi>hear the Voice of our Beloved</hi> neither Week-day, nor Lord's-day. This was <hi>David</hi>'s outcry, [<hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> I cry night and day, but <hi>thou heareſt me not,</hi>] (ſo as not to anſwer me with thy Voice,) Pſal. 22.1,2. yet he keeps high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Thoughts of even a <hi>ſilent God,</hi> ſaying, [but thou
<hi>art Holy, and inhabits Praiſes,</hi> &amp;c.] ver. 3. and he complains alſo, [<hi>Lord, how long wilt thou be Angry againſt the Prayers of thy People?</hi>] Pſal. 80.4. And thus it was with the <hi>Spouſe, complaining,</hi> [I <hi>called</hi> him, but he <hi>gave me no anſwer,</hi> Cant. 5.6. this is ſad to Love-ſick Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">The (6<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> is, The Love-ſick Spouſe, even while ſlumbering, can know the <hi>Voice of her Beloved,</hi> Cant. 5.2,3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where ſhe ſaith, [<hi>it is the Voice of my
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48866:88"/>Beloved</hi> that <hi>knocketh,</hi> &amp;c.] not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was but an half-ſleep, for the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, man of her heart,</hi> (ſo called, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4.) <hi>was awake;</hi> but alſo becauſe of her former frequent knowledge and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this
[<hi>Kol-Dodi</hi>] or her <hi>Beloved</hi>'s Voice. Thus it is common among us, that we know whoſe Voice it is that calleth us, when foregoing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance hath made it familiar to us, tho' we be betwixt ſleeping and waking, eſpecially if we ſhake our ſelves as <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> did,
<hi>Judg.</hi> 16.20.</p>
            <p n="7">The (7<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> is, When we have not been ſo dutiful and attentive to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Voice, as we ought to be, ſo as to obey his Call, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet then muſt we make ſerious reflections upon our own negligence, and ſeverely cenſure our ſelves for refuſing ſuch bleſſed Embracements as the Soul-ſick Spouſe did, repeating with regret every <hi>Title</hi> of Love, and every <hi>Accent</hi> he had given her, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Action</hi> he had done in order to his own reception with her: All along aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her own fault and folly, that a King ſhould court a Beggar and be rejected, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.3,5,8.</p>
            <p n="8">The (8<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> is, This
<hi>Kol-Dodi,</hi> &amp;c. is an abrupt paſſage, proceeding from a pang of Love, whereof ſhe was ſick, and<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48866:89"/>now lies (as it were) languiſhing at Hope's Hoſpital, ever liſtning and Heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to hear her Bridegrooms Voice; and when ſhe heard it, ſhe rejoiced at it, not only as the Damſel <hi>Rhoda</hi> did to hear the Voice of <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts
12.14. but as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> did when our <hi>Lord's Mother ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi> her, as <hi>her Babe,</hi> ſo the <hi>Spouſes Heart</hi> leaped within her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.40,41.</p>
            <p n="9">The (9<hi>th</hi>) <hi>Remark</hi> from the Text,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. is, The <hi>Voice of Chriſt</hi> is a very <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Voice</hi> unto all <hi>gracious hearts;</hi> as here to the Spouſe: ſhe firſt heard his Voice, and then cries, <hi>behold he comes. John Baptiſt</hi> was call'd a <hi>Voice</hi> to <hi>prepare a way for Chriſt's coming,</hi> Mark 1.2,3. So the <hi>Spouſe</hi> here looks upon
<hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> as a forerunner of himſelf, and of his coming to her to communicate more of his Graces and Comforts to her Love-ſick Soul. No ſooner doth <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſweet Voice enter into our Ears, and ſinks down into our Hearts, but preſently we are <hi>made to hear of Joy and Gladneſs,</hi> and <hi>our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Bones begin to Rejoice</hi>] Pſal.
51.8. <hi>the Spouſe tells her Friends ſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Enquiry how we may know the Voice of Chriſt, our Beeloved, from the Voice of Falſe Lovers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer the</hi> (1<hi>ſt</hi>) There is much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty oftentimes to diſcern a difference,<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48866:89"/>becauſe
<hi>Satan</hi> can imitate the Servants of God, his Magicians did the like to
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s Miracle with their Enchantments, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. until God did convince them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.19. yea, and plagued themſelves alſo for their Cheat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.11. nor could <hi>Samuel</hi> himſelf have ſpoken more gravely, more devoutly, and more divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than
<hi>Satan</hi> did unto <hi>Saul,</hi> who hired the Witch of <hi>Endor</hi> to conjure him up in <hi>Samuel</hi>'s ſimilitude, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15, to 20.
<hi>Satan himſelf is transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of Light; it is no marvel then, if his Miniſters, Falſe Apoſtles, Deceitful Workers, transform themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 11.13,14,15. and the <hi>cry</hi> of <hi>Folly</hi> is like the <hi>cry</hi> of
<hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> Prov. 9.4,16. the Voices are alike, and the Words are the ſame in both, [<hi>Whoſo is ſimple, let him turn in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. yet are they diſtinguiſhable by many <hi>Characters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer the</hi> (2<hi>d</hi>) The <hi>Voice of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> doth differ from the <hi>Voice of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> (which
<hi>Chriſt' ſheep will not hear, nor follow,</hi> John 10.4,5,8.) By theſe few <hi>Diſcriminations,</hi> The <hi>firſt Diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Character</hi> is, <hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> hath in it ſelf a ſelf-diſcovering property; 'tis the excellency of it, to bring along with it its own Evidence; how do we know<pb n="170" facs="tcp:48866:90"/>that Light is Light, but by that evidence of Light which it hath in it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus Fire doth diſcover it ſelf by its own <hi>Heat,</hi> as well as
<hi>Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Character</hi> is, <hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> is attended with <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> inſomuch as his Hearers ſtood <hi>aſtoniſhed at his Doctrine,</hi> Luke 4.32. and <hi>they were amazed,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What a Word is this?</hi> for with
<hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> he <hi>caſteth out Devils,</hi> ver.
36. Thus <hi>David</hi> tells us, [the <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> is powerful, and <hi>full of Majeſty,</hi> it <hi>breaketh</hi> the <hi>talleſt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars,</hi> and the <hi>ſtrongeſt Oaks,</hi> &amp;c. it <hi>maketh</hi> the <hi>Hindes</hi> to <hi>Calve,</hi> (which is the moſt difficult Birth of all Females, <hi>Job</hi> 39.1. they being ſo narrow-made Creatures,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And the <hi>Voice of the Lord</hi> ſtilleth the Rage of Rivers and Seas, by <hi>ſitting upon the Floods,</hi> and keeping them under his Call,] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.4,5,6,7, to 11.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Character</hi> is, The <hi>Voice of Chriſt reacheth the Heart,</hi> it <hi>maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the Secrets of the Hearts of Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> at a Sermon-hearing, and cauſeth them to <hi>fall down</hi> and <hi>worſhip God,</hi> and to ſay, that <hi>God is in his Prophets of a truth,</hi>] 1 Cor. 14.24,25. Thus when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpeaketh <hi>with a ſtrong hand</hi> (as he did to the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Iſa. 8.11.) to any perſon, then <hi>Chriſt opens the Heart,</hi> (as<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48866:90"/>he did the <hi>Heart</hi> of <hi>Lydia,</hi> Acts 16.14.) tho' it be called a
<hi>ſmall ſtill Voice,</hi> 1 Kings 19.12. yet having the <hi>Lord in it,</hi> it is <hi>mighty</hi> in its <hi>Operations</hi> for <hi>pulling down of the ſtrong holds of Satan,</hi> and <hi>caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down every high thing,</hi> that exalts its ſelf againſt God in us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4,5.
<hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> hath <hi>Spirit</hi> and Life in it, <hi>John</hi>
6.63. and therefore is it only effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to break the heart for ſin, to diſſolve the Stone, and to mortifie ſin in it, and to quicken it for God, and to <hi>change it into the Image of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 3.18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth Character</hi> is, <hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> calleth from evil to good, from ways of wickedneſs to ways of holineſs, it always cries, [<hi>come up hither to God</hi>] Rev. 11.12. but never [<hi>go down thither to ſin,</hi>] this <hi>latter</hi> is the Voice of an
<hi>Egyptian,</hi> and when we meet it, we muſt (with <hi>Moſes</hi>)
<hi>ſlay it;</hi> but the <hi>former</hi> is an <hi>Hebrew</hi> Voice, which we <hi>muſt ſave alive</hi> as <hi>he</hi> did, Exod. 2.11,12.
<hi>Chriſt's Breath</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Spirit</hi> of
<hi>Holineſs,</hi> Rom. 1.3. and always calls us to be <hi>Holy as he is Holy,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. and 2 Pet. 3.11. <hi>Truth</hi> calls to forſake the Fooliſh, <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.6. but <hi>Error</hi> calls to Fleſhly Delights,
<hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16, 17. therefore we muſt reject that Voice, which promotes not the <hi>power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:48866:91"/>The <hi>Fifth Character</hi> is,
<hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> is alway conſonant to the Light and <hi>Law of Nature.</hi> This is the remainder of God's Image in faln mankind, ſome ſherd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of do ſtill remain after <hi>Adam's fall,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>Cain</hi> knew that <hi>Murther, Joſeph</hi> that <hi>Adultery,</hi> his Brethren that <hi>Theft,</hi> &amp;c. were all heinous ſins, long before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes.</hi> Hereby likewiſe [the <hi>Gentiles who have not the Law, do by Nature the things contained in the Law; theſe are a Law to themſelves, which ſhew the work of the Law written in their Hearts,</hi> their <hi>Conſcience bearing witneſs,</hi> and either <hi>excuſing,</hi> or <hi>accuſing,</hi> &amp;c.] Rom. 2.14,15. Therefore that Voice which croſſeth the Voice of an awakened Conſcience is not <hi>Chriſt's Voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Sixth Character</hi> is, the Voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alway congruous to the Light and Law of the Holy Scripture; for
<hi>Chriſt</hi> (who is called <hi>the word,</hi> John 1.1.) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict himſelf, <hi>He is not Yea and Nay, but in him was Yea,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 1.17,18,19,20. He is the ſame both in his Voice that is ſpoken, and in his Word that is written; therefore our Lord ſaith, [<hi>to the Law and to the Teſtimony, if any ſpeak not according to this word, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no Light in them,</hi>] Iſa. 8.20. The <hi>Word written</hi> muſt be the<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48866:91"/>
               <hi>Rule of our Lives,</hi> becauſe it ſhall be our <hi>Judge after</hi> Death, as our Lord ſaith,
[the <hi>word that I have ſpoken, the ſame ſhall judge you at the laſt day,</hi>] John 12.48. Rom. 2.16. <hi>according to my Goſpel:</hi> So that if any pretended Voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> come to us, which holds not congruity with the <hi>Scipture</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> Dan. 10.21. 1 Joh. 4.1. we muſt look on it as a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Seventh Character</hi> is, The <hi>Voice of Chriſt</hi> always calls to <hi>weighty matters,</hi> and that in <hi>order,</hi> &amp;c. but never to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Deeds, and in diſorder and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus
<hi>Nehemiah perceived</hi> it was <hi>none of God's call,</hi> that called him
<hi>from God's work,</hi> no fewer than five or ſix times, to trifling diſcourſes with them in private, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neh. 6.4,5,6,12. and thus
<hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>exaſperated</hi> againſt the <hi>Divining Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> for <hi>diſturbing</hi> them <hi>many days</hi> from their
<hi>Praying work,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 16.16,17,18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eighth and Laſt Character,</hi> (to mention no more for brevity ſake) is, <hi>Chriſt's Voice</hi> doth put the Right Hearer of it into an <hi>acting</hi> frame and <hi>doing</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; for thus he ſaith, [<hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord,</hi> and <hi>do not the things that I ſay,</hi> Luke 6.46. <hi>'Tis not Hearers, but Doers whom God reſpects,</hi> Rom. 2.13.<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48866:92"/>
               <hi>Hearers only</hi> and
<hi>not Doers deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Jam. 1.22. 'Tis not the
<hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>talking,</hi> but the <hi>walking</hi> and <hi>working Chriſtian</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> loveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">Inferences from hence, (1<hi>ſt</hi>) That we may hear the Voice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> we muſt come to every Ordinance in publick, and to every Duty in private in an hearkning poſture; [<hi>I will hearken what the Lord will ſay,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 85.8. [<hi>Speak, Lord, for thy Servant heareth,</hi>] 1 Sam. 3.19. [<hi>To hearken is better than the fat of Rams,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.22. [<hi>To day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your hearts,</hi>] Heb. 3.7. but liſten and hearken with <hi>bored Ears,</hi> Pſal. 40.6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2<hi>dly</hi>) Pray for a <hi>Diſcerning Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.10. that we miſtake not the Younger for the Elder, as blind
<hi>Iſaac</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27,21,22. The Voice may be
<hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s, when the Hands may be like the rough Hands of
<hi>Eſau,</hi> &amp;c. and we may think that we are embracing our beloved
<hi>Rachel</hi> all the night, when in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-light, it proves a Blear-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> as it was impoſed upon <hi>Jacob</hi> by churliſh
<hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 29.25. and therefore muſt we pray for <hi>God's Spirit to lead us into all truth,</hi> John 14.26. if it do <hi>witneſs with our Spirits,</hi> Rom. 8.16.

[<hi>If I be deceived, my God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me,</hi> Jer. 20.7. For the Spirit of Truth doth not only aſſure us of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but alſo of the truth of the Voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us, to prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

[<hi>we ſhould follow any that follow Chriſt,</hi>] 1 Cor. 11.1. [<hi>Wo to them that call evil good,</hi> &amp;c.] Iſa. 5.20. therefore ſhould we ſay with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> [<hi>Come near my Son, that I may feel thee,</hi>] Gen. 27.21. And <hi>John turned to ſee the Voice of him that ſpake to him,</hi> Rev. 1.12. And the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, [<hi>our Hands have handled</hi> of the <hi>word of Life,</hi>] 1 John 1.1. the <hi>Ear tryeth words,</hi> &amp;c. Job. 12.11. <hi>As Timothy muſt lay hands ſudddenly on no man,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.22. So we on <hi>no Thing, no Voice,</hi> &amp;c. for we may hear a <hi>noiſe</hi> only of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but not the diſtinct arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate Voice of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as thoſe that journied with

<hi>She</hi> her ſelf doth acknowledge, ſaying, [<hi>My Spirit rejoiceth in the Lord my Saviour,</hi>] Luke 1.47. Had <hi>She</hi> had no ſin (as the

Now the Phraſe [<hi>Conterit Caput,</hi>] ſignifies he ſhall knock thee on the Head, he ſhall crack thy Crown; therefore this muſt be our ſerious enquiry, Whether <hi>Chriſt, in us, the hope of Glory,</hi> 
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:48866:95"/>Col. 1.27. (who <hi>dwells in our Hearts by Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 3.17. and who is the <hi>Stronger Man</hi>) hath yet come upon this <hi>Strong Man,</hi> and <hi>overcome him,</hi> and
<hi>taken from his Armour wherein he truſted,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 11.21,22. Hath our Lord, in us, drawn the Dragon out of his Den, where he lived long peaceably, that is, in our Heatrs all the <hi>time of our ignorance?</hi> Acts
17.30. And hath he broke the Head of the Tempter, ſo that he leaves nothing for us to combat with, ſave only <hi>Tail-Temptations!</hi> And Chriſt ſtrengthens his Members both to carry on, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat this Spiritual Combat, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>more than Conquerors</hi> at the laſt, as bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledgeth in three places of Holy Scripture. The firſt is, [<hi>It is not I that lives,</hi> but it is <hi>Chriſt that liveth in me,</hi> &amp;c. Gal. 2.20.] The <hi>Second Place</hi> is Rom. 8.37. where he aſcribeth the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our being Conquerors (as before to the
<hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in him, ſo) to the <hi>Love of Chriſt</hi> to him, and to all true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi> And the third place is <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. where he gives the glory of his one ſort of Omnipotency to the <hi>power of Chriſt</hi> in him.</p>
            <p>The (2<hi>d</hi>) <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Conqueror</hi> is, If we find, by real experience, that we do gain ground of our Spiritual Enemies, (thoſe <hi>Tail-Temptations</hi>) as <hi>Joſhuah</hi> did
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48866:95"/>win ground upon the curſed <hi>Canaanites</hi> in his daily Wars againſt them: Firſt, he conquered that Land which lay upon the far ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and then paſſing over that River, he conquered them on the other ſide alſo, having the bleſſed
<hi>Meſſiah</hi> along with him, who ſaid to <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> [as
<hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Lord's Hoſt am I come,</hi>] Joſh. 5.15. yet ſometimes we find how hardly he got the Victory over the City <hi>Ai,</hi> when <hi>Achan</hi>'s ſin proved too ſtrong for <hi>Joſhuah</hi>'s proweſs, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.5. Inſomuch that he won ground of the Enemy (as it were) by Inches only, according to the word of the Lord, ſaving, [<hi>The Lord thy God will drive out thoſe Nations, before thee, by little and little,</hi> and <hi>not all at once,</hi> &amp;c.] Deut. 7.22. and the Lord did order and over-rule it there for <hi>Iſraels</hi> good. Thus it is in our
<hi>Spiritual Warfare,</hi> tho' God's promiſe is to <hi>tread down Satan under our Feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20. yet God will not make his promiſes good too ſoon. It was for their own good, as in that fore-named Scripture,
[<hi>leſt the Beaſts of the Field increaſe upon thee,</hi>] for he is a
<hi>God</hi> of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>waiteth</hi> to give us his Mercies, when they may do us moſt good; and therefore [<hi>bleſſed are they that wait for him,</hi>] Iſa. 30.18. He gives his Mercy in the beſt Seaſon, tho' not ſo<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48866:96"/>ſoon as we do deſire; we long to conquer our <hi>Corruptions</hi> (thoſe curſed <hi>Canaanites</hi>) in one day, which our Lord hath ordered and ordained to be the work of our whole Lives; our Corruptions, as the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> are left yet unſubdued, only to prove us in our owning God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Judg. 2.21,22. and Judg. 3.4. This
<hi>mortifying of ſin,</hi> (as well as <hi>fortifying of grace,</hi>) is
<hi>penſum Diurnum &amp; Perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uum,</hi> both a daily and a perpetual Task. God will keep a Ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at our Foot to keep us humble. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh,</hi> a <hi>Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Satan to buffet him,</hi> leſt he ſhould <hi>be exalted above meaſure</hi> with his late <hi>Rapture</hi> into <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.2,3,4,7. There will be work enough for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Grace, till it be turned into Glory. Notwithſtanding the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> with their <hi>Iron Chariots,</hi> were ſo ſtrong, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not drive them out, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 17.16. yet the <hi>faithful God,</hi> (as he is called,) <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.9. and <hi>who will not be ſlack,</hi> ver. 10. did promiſe that they ſhould <hi>drive them out,</hi> tho' they had <hi>Iron Chariots,</hi> and tho' <hi>they were ſtrong,</hi> Joſh. 17.18. the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> was too mighty for them. Thus we complain concerning our Corruptions, that they fall not faſt enough by <hi>mortifying Grace;</hi> but we muſt know for our Comfort, [our
<hi>Faithful<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48866:96"/>God will not be ſlack,</hi> (as before) for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our curſed <hi>Canaanites.</hi> He indeed may ſeem to be
<hi>ſlow</hi> in our thoughts, yet he is never <hi>ſlack,</hi> but will be ever ſure; he will not ſuffer his <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> to <hi>fail,</hi> nor <hi>alter the thing that is gone out of his Lips,</hi> Pſal. 89.33. what he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> with his <hi>Mouth,</hi> he <hi>fulfils</hi> with his
<hi>Hand,</hi> 1 Kings 8.24. he will <hi>do</hi> what he <hi>hath ſaid,</hi>
2 Sam. 7.25. whether <hi>ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> Tit. 1.1,2. which never failed in any Age; no nor his <hi>Menaces</hi> neither, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. nor will he fail in this of <hi>treading Satan under our Feet ſhortly,</hi> Prov.
16.20. In the mean time let us enquire, Do we gain ground of our Spiritual Enemies? doth the <hi>Houſe of Saul</hi> in us wax <hi>weaker and weaker,</hi> and the <hi>Houſe of David</hi> in us grow <hi>ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> as 2 Sam. 3.1. can we feel our Lord a <hi>deſtroying the works</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi> in us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>John</hi>
3.8. tho' as yet they be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtroyed? Are we <hi>daily dying to ſin,</hi> tho' not as yet wholly dead to it? even this may enſure us of Victory at laſt; let us compare time with time: may we but experience, how heretofore the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly law in thee had thy Sabbaths, thy Time, thy Strength, yea thy very Heart and Affections; but now by the power of Renewing Grace) the Law of the Spirit<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48866:97"/>in thee hath reſcued (at laeſt) a little of all the aforeſaid, and ſubjected that little under the
<hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> ſo that thou finds thoſe two contrary Laws now in thee, to wit, the <hi>Law of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> and the
<hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Mind, warring againſt each other,</hi> &amp;c. Rom.
7.15, to 23. which makes thee cry out, (as the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed Damſelf</hi> did in <hi>the field,</hi> when ſhe was aſſaulted by a <hi>man too ſtrong for her,</hi> Deut. 22.27. as <hi>Amnon</hi> was too ſtrong for
<hi>Tamar,</hi> 2 Sam. 13.14.) ſo doſt thou cry out with <hi>Paul,</hi>
[<hi>Oh wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of Death?</hi> and <hi>thank God</hi> (with him) that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord is thy Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer;</hi> ſaying likewiſe, (as he did) ſo then
<hi>with the Mind</hi> I my <hi>ſelf do ſerve the Law of God,</hi> but with the <hi>Fleſh</hi> the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> Rom. 7.24,25. If we find our ſelves in no worſe a condition than that of the Holy Apoſtle himſelf, this cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and diſcouraging to us; the ſame conflict betwixt two contrary Laws is common to all Chriſtians: For as <hi>Paul</hi> had informed the believing <hi>Romans</hi> of it as above: So he affirms, yea, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms</hi> the ſame Truth to the believing <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſaying, [<hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> and ye <hi>ſhall not fulfil the luſts</hi> thereof; for the <hi>Fleſh luſteth</hi> againſt the Spirit,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48866:97"/>and the <hi>Spirit againſt the Fleſh,</hi> and theſe are <hi>contrary</hi> the <hi>one to the other;</hi> ſo that ye cannot <hi>do the things</hi> that <hi>ye would,</hi> &amp;c.] Gal. 5.16,17. The meaning whereof is, that as we cannot do the <hi>good</hi> which we would do, becauſe the <hi>Fleſh</hi> doth hinder us; ſo we cannot do the <hi>evil</hi> which we would (by the unrenewed part of our wills) do, becauſe the Spirit hinders us. Now may we but find by ſound experience that the <hi>Law</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit gains ground</hi> of the Law of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> in us; this is a comfortable Character, that we ſhall be Conquerors in this Spiritual Conflict. Thus Satan's Aſſaults now are feebler than heretofore againſt us, like that of the old <hi>Gauls,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, <hi>prior impetus eſt pluſquam Virorum, poſterior minus quam faeminarum,</hi> more than Men at firſt, but leſs than Women at laſt.</p>
            <p>The Third Comfortable <hi>Character</hi> of a Conqueror is, that he is able to break the Ranks of the Van-guard, or Fore-front of his Enemies, and ſo force them to draw back. 'Tis a great encouragement to a General to ſet his Feet, and the Feet of his Army upon the ſame ground where his Adverſaries pitched their Battalia's againſt him; he knows, if once they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to <hi>flinch,</hi> they will ſoon alſo begin to <hi>flee,</hi> eſpecially if he can gain their<pb n="186" facs="tcp:48866:98"/>moſt advantagious ground from which (as from an higher ſtanding) they did moſtly annoy him: but much more if he can ſhatter and diſorder their Front, where the men of greateſt Gallantry are ever moſt politickly placed; if once they come into confuſion, and be (as we ſay) hand over head, then he doth more eaſily break in upon them, and ſo rout them out of the field. It was once a notable ſtratagem of an <hi>Engliſh General,</hi> that when he came up cloſe to the face of his Foes, he ordered his Army to make a loud and univerſal outcry
[they <hi>run,</hi> in the <hi>Rear,</hi> they <hi>run,</hi> they
<hi>run;</hi>] this Cry did ſo daunt the Front, (who feared it to be true) that thereby both the Van and the Rear did run away indeed. Thus is it with us in our Spiritual Warfare; our Spiritual Enemies do not war againſt us as is done in a Duel, (but <hi>one to one</hi>) but here is many againſt one; thoſe <hi>fleſhly luſts</hi> that <hi>fight</hi> againſt <hi>our Souls</hi> are not one only, but many in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
2.11. And the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt works of the Fleſh are many: There be no fewer than
<hi>ſeventeen</hi> of them reckoned up, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19,20,21. and yet not all by much, for <hi>Paul</hi> comes off with (and <hi>ſuch like,</hi> &amp;c.] Yea the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle calls our Adverſary, [<hi>A Body of Sin,</hi>]<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48866:98"/>Rom. 6.6. becauſe it wars againſt us in a
<hi>full Body,</hi> made up of many of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Warriors, a very great Army. Now if we go out in the <hi>ſtrength of the Lord</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.16. and take the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> Heb. 2.10. along with us, (who <hi>teacheth our hands to war,</hi> and our
<hi>fingers to fight,</hi> Pſal. 144.1.) then are we made able to <hi>run through a Troop</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18.29. and to <hi>leap over the Wall,</hi> yea and to break even a Bow of Steel by our Arms, <hi>ver.</hi>
34. Alas, we have all cauſe to cry (as <hi>Leah</hi> did, <hi>Gen.</hi>
30.11. <hi>behold a Troop cometh,</hi> yea ſuch a Troop of fleſhly Luſts as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Gad</hi>) for a while; but this is our comfort, that
<hi>Gad</hi> doth overcome at laſt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.19. If we can but break the Ranks of our Spiritual Enemies, ſo that they cannot come up in a full Body againſt us as formerly, then is there <hi>hope in Iſrael con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing,</hi> that we ſhall better conquer them one after another when they are ſcattered aſunder, (<hi>divide &amp; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> divide and rule ſaid <hi>Machiavel;</hi> but <hi>vis unita fortior eſt,</hi> ſtrength united is ſtrong;) eſpecially having God's promiſe of a Conqueſt, as the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> had to conquer <hi>Egypt,</hi> in whoſe behalf God ſaith, [<hi>I will put my Sword into his Hand,</hi> and will ſtrengthen his Arms, but I will<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48866:99"/>
               <hi>break Pharaoh's Arms,</hi> and he ſhall <hi>groan before him</hi> with the <hi>groanings</hi> of a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>wounded man,</hi>] Ezek. 30.24. accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly if we can but ſay, that the Lord hath put his Sword into our Hands, even the <hi>Sword</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> which is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Epheſ. 6.17. (wherewith our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf conquered <hi>Satan</hi> in all his three Aſſaults, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.4,7,10. ſaying, <hi>Scriptum eſt,</hi> it
<hi>is Written,</hi> againſt them all) then the Devil will leave us, as he did our Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. (at leaſt <hi>for a Seaſon,</hi> L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ke 4.13.) and <hi>Angels came</hi> to bring Food to him after his forty days faſting. Thus likewiſe if the Lord will ſtrengthen our Arms alſo (as well as put his Sword into our Hands,) yea and break the Arms of that <hi>Great Dragon, Pharaoh,</hi> as he is called, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
29.3. then ſhall he lie groaning before us, (as in the example aforeſaid) with the groanings of a deadly wounded man. According both to the Church's Prayer, [<hi>awake, awake,</hi> thou <hi>Arm of the Lord,</hi> art thou not
<hi>it</hi> that <hi>cut Rahab</hi> in <hi>pieces,</hi> and <hi>wounded the Dragon;</hi> Oh put on ſtrength as in the <hi>days of old,</hi>] Iſai.
51.9. and 27.1. and according alſo to God's promiſe, [<hi>thou ſhalt tread upon the Lion</hi> and the <hi>Adder,</hi> the <hi>young Lion</hi> and the <hi>Dragon</hi> ſhalt thou <hi>trample under Foot,</hi>] Pſal. 91.13.
<hi>becauſe <pb n="189" facs="tcp:48866:99"/>he hath ſet his love upon me,</hi> therefore <hi>will I deliver him,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 14. yea and according to

Note well,</hi> This extraordinary Gift laſted until <hi>Chriſt</hi> was publickly profeſſed in the World: Indeed this <hi>great Red Dragon</hi> will be wrongful to the <hi>Woman,</hi> (the <hi>Church</hi>) and to her <hi>Seed,</hi> Rev. 12.3,4,7,9,16,17. until our Lord come and lay hold on him, and chain him up, <hi>&amp;c. Rev.</hi> 20.2,3. and <hi>tread down Satan under our Feet ſhortly,</hi> Rom. 16.20. In the mean time we muſt endeavour to ſay with
<hi>David,</hi> even three times over, [tho' our Spiritual Enemies be as
<hi>many</hi> as are all the <hi>Nations</hi> which compaſs us about, (even the <hi>Philiſtins, Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Amaleck,</hi> &amp;c.) yet in the

<hi>take them away as with a Whirlwind,</hi> both <hi>living,</hi> and in
<hi>his wrath,</hi>] Pſal. 58.9.

Their toil and travel was not greatly troubleſome in their compaſſing <hi>Jericho,</hi> but once at a time in all the <hi>ſix days;</hi> but upon the <hi>ſeventh</hi> day, they had the Task of compaſſing the City ſeven times, one immediately after another, and therefore it is ſaid [that they roſe up early at the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that day,]
<hi>ver.</hi> 25. even ſo ought we to lay out our continual endeavours to pull down the Walls of the <hi>Strong Holds of Satan,</hi> even all the

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> So when our laſt <hi>Sabbath</hi> approacheth, we ſhould ſtir up our ſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our ability, that we may then
<hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. that we
<hi>may make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. and that we may make ſure work for a better World, before we go hence to be ſeen no more,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> All this muſt be done by <hi>Faith</hi> alſo, then down goes our <hi>Jericho.</hi> Then our Lord <hi>Chriſt</hi> will ſay of us, as he ſaid of his Golden Church at <hi>Thyatira,</hi> [I know thy Works, that thy laſt be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thy firſt,] <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.19. Tho' our
<hi>beginning</hi> was but <hi>ſmall,</hi> yet our <hi>latter end</hi> ſhould <hi>greatly encreaſe,</hi> Job 8.7. Our laſt days ſhould be our beſt days in our earneſt purſuit for Heaven. As the Stone deſcending from an high Tower, the nearer it approaches to its center, the faſter it flies and falls; ſo the nearer we come to the end of our Race, we ought to run with the greater ſpeed, that <hi>no Man, no Devil, no Thing, may take our Crown</hi> from us; which is promiſed only to thoſe <hi>that overcome,</hi> Rev. 3.11.12. For as old <hi>David</hi> literally ſpake to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
[<hi>whoſoever</hi> getteth up into the Gutter, and ſmiteth the
<hi>Jebuſites,</hi> and the Blind and the Lame (Idols) the <hi>hatred

This Royal Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Joab</hi> embraceth, (that he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the King's Favour which he had loſt by his barbarous Murdering of brave <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi>) 1 Chron. 11.6. and he <hi>conquered</hi> the City out of the hands of the curſed <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> which was after called
<hi>Sion,</hi> and the <hi>City of David.</hi> So our <hi>David</hi> Myſtical maketh a more Royal Motion to us, ſaying, [<hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne,</hi> even as I <hi>alſo overcame,</hi> and <hi>am ſet down with my Father in his Throne,</hi>] Rev. 3.21. in which place [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:48866:114"/>Therefore it moſt highly concerns us to enquire, whether (with <hi>Joab</hi>) we have <hi>ſcaled the Walls</hi> of the
<hi>Strong Holds</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> whether we have <hi>gained the Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which is done when we are bleſt with an <hi>hearing Ear</hi> to the word of Life; for the <hi>Ear</hi> is (as it were) the <hi>Gutter</hi> that conveys even the Waters of Life into the Soul of Man; for thus it is ſaid,
[<hi>Hear and your Souls ſhall live</hi>] Iſai. 55.3. and [<hi>Faith cometh by Hearing the Word of God,</hi>] Rom. 10.17. We muſt enquire likewiſe, whether (with <hi>Joab</hi> alſo) we have ſmitten thoſe curſed
<hi>Canaanites</hi> (the <hi>Jebuſites</hi>) namely our own <hi>Carnal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions;</hi> enquire (I ſay) <hi>what Rule</hi> we have <hi>obtained over our own Spirits;</hi> [he <hi>that is ſlow to Anger, is better than the Mighty;</hi> and he that <hi>ruleth his Spirit,</hi> is <hi>more honourable than he that conquereth a City,</hi>] Prov. 16.32. This is not only Manly, but Godly alſo: Whereas he that <hi>hath no Rule</hi> over his <hi>own Spirit,</hi> is like a <hi>City</hi> that is <hi>broken down</hi> and

Such perſons are like <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Hazor,</hi> that had neither <hi>Gates</hi> nor <hi>Bars,</hi> Jer. 49.31. thoſe Souls are not fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in with the fear of God; and the <hi>Strong Man Satan,</hi> well armed, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for every evil Work, (as the <hi>Man of God</hi> is furniſhed for every good Work, <pb n="220" facs="tcp:48866:115"/>as before, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17.) keeps ſtill the <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> of his <hi>Strong Hold</hi> in them, and they were never yet bleſt with a Viſit from that bleſſed <hi>Stronger Man,</hi> (the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>) to <hi>diſpoſſeſs him.</hi> Oh thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are they, to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith (as he did to that <hi>Demoniack,</hi> Mark

            <p>The <hi>Sixth Character</hi> of a Conqueror is, <hi>Wholly</hi> to
<hi>diſarm</hi> the <hi>Conquered.</hi> Thus the <hi>Stronger Man,</hi> when he had <hi>come upon the Strong Man,</hi> and had overcome him, he <hi>took away all his Armour wherein he truſted,</hi> Luke 11.22. that is, thoſe that were his offenſive Weapons, to wit, the <hi>World, Sin</hi> and

And <hi>Satan,</hi> finding all theſe Weapons ſo ſucceſsful, is ſaid to <hi>truſt in them,</hi> as <hi>Goliah</hi> did in his <hi>Armour,</hi> which made him triumph <hi>before his Victory,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>David,</hi> [come, and I will give thy Fleſh to the Fowls of the Air, and to the Beaſts of the Field,] 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.44. as if <hi>David</hi> had been ſome Boy, to be frighted with his big Boaſts of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Confidence: and in <hi>ver.</hi>

46, 47. which was accordingly accompliſhed. Thus <hi>he</hi> who is call'd both <hi>David's Son,</hi> and <hi>David's Lord,</hi> Mat. 22.45. The

<hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. Thus this <hi>Alligory</hi> may be farther enlarged, as <hi>David</hi> carried the Head of <hi>Goliah</hi> to
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and (as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) ſet it up upon a Pinacle of the Temple, (where <hi>Satan</hi> ſet our Saviour by God's permiſſion afterwards) as an high Monument of his Happy Victory: This <hi>David</hi> did, after he had ſhewed this ſame Head to <hi>Saul,</hi> ver. 57. And as for

<hi>David</hi> prevailed with the High Prieſt <hi>Ahimeleck</hi> to reſtore it to him again, as before it had been his own, won by his Valour, and therefore he accounted <hi>no other Sword like that,</hi> which would be a ſtanding Remembrancer of his former At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements by the mighty preſence of the Lord his God, wherewith he did encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage himſelf in the day of his great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.6. even ſo our <hi>Myſtical David deſtroyed him who had the power of Death,</hi> that is, <hi>the Devil,</hi> with his own Weapon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Chriſt's Death</hi> was the

<hi>Sword of the Spirit,</hi> which it the <hi>Word</hi> of God,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17. of which it may be better ſaid, than was ſaid of the other, [<hi>there is none like that;</hi>] for if the word of

            <p>The <hi>Seventh Character</hi> of a <hi>Conqueror</hi> is, to

Thus alſo if we be <hi>Conquerors,</hi> we muſt endeavour to batter down all the <hi>ſtrong holds of Satan</hi> in us with Sling-ſtones, (as was the cuſtom of that time, which is now done by mighty Bullets out of the Mouths of great Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.) The Slingers went about <hi>Kirha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſeth,</hi> and broke down only the Towers of it; this was the will and pleaſure of the Conqueror, not quite to demoliſh the Walls of it, as he did the other Cities: It were well if we could ſling ſuch ſmooth Stones (as <hi>David</hi> did at

And thus it is with all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Conquerors, (through <hi>Chriſt's love to them,</hi> and <hi>his ſtrength in them;</hi>) they pray to the Lord that all their fleſhly Luſts, (which

2.12. This is the <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> where,
<hi>Note well,</hi> that three Adverbs (<hi>Sobre, Juſte &amp; Pie</hi>) do much exceed the three Adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives (<hi>Sobrius, Juſtus &amp; Pius,</hi>) for in thoſe latter are included only Acts of Grace; but in the former are included the <hi>Habits of Grace;</hi> for it is not one ſingle <hi>Act</hi> or two, but a conſtant Habit of Grace, (notwithſtanding ſome interruptions in our way) that gives the denomination of a true Chriſtian. Now this excellent ſtate can never be attained, unleſs we firſt

Tho' they had deceived him but once, yet our <hi>deceitful Luſts</hi> have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us even times, and days without number; and in all other Scripture-inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, we find that evermore the <hi>conquered</hi> become <hi>Tributaries</hi> to the
<hi>Conqueror.</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>ſt</hi>) Thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> that could not be driven out, yet they did <hi>ſerve Iſrael under Tribute,</hi> Joſh.
16.10. according to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 20.11.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Thus the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they became ſtrong, did put the <hi>Canaanites</hi> to Tribute, as <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Judg. 1.28. and <hi>Napthali,</hi> ver. 33. and the <hi>Danites,</hi> (by the help of <hi>Joſeph</hi> his Brother) <hi>ver.</hi> 35.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Thus likewiſe did <hi>David</hi> unto <hi>Moab,</hi> after he had <hi>caſt his Shoe over it,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 60.8. as its Conqueror, tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under foot; then the <hi>Moabites</hi> became
<hi>David's</hi> Servants, and they <hi>brought him Gifts,</hi> 1 Chron. 18.2. And this was a prodigious Gift unto <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſor, namely, an hundred thouſand Lambs, and an hundred thouſand Rams with their Wool, 2 King. 3.4. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Moab</hi> was a great<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48866:120"/>Sheep-Maſter, and his Tribute he paid yearly was this vaſt number of Lambs, (with all their Dams alſo,) and this vaſt number of Rams, in ſuch a ſeaſon of the Year, when their Wool was beſt grown upon their Backs; and many more ſuch examples of Tribute might be added. Oh that we could ask our own Hearts, whether our <hi>Affections</hi> have been
<hi>conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> the <hi>Stronger Man</hi> and
<hi>Conqueror:</hi> NB. <hi>Are all our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons turned into Graces,</hi> as the <hi>Affection</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> into the <hi>Grace</hi> of
<hi>Fear,</hi> and the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> into the
<hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> and ſo of the reſt; then our Lord hath laid his Laws upon them, and they pay each of them their Tribute to
<hi>Chriſt.</hi> Oh bleſſed is that Soul, that pays ſo many
<hi>thouſand Lambs</hi> (or <hi>devout Prayers</hi>) to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the
<hi>King of Glory,</hi> which muſt needs be numerous, if both
<hi>Occaſional</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Prayers,</hi> if <hi>publick</hi> and
<hi>private Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> both in our <hi>Cloſets,</hi> and in our
<hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> for the ſpace of one whole year, be reckoned up all together. If we do all theſe things, then this <hi>Great King</hi> will
<hi>greatly delight in our Beauty,</hi> Pſal. 45.10.11. and give us
<hi>Victory over our laſt Enemy, Death,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> will

            <p n="1">(1<hi>ſt</hi>) Gray Hairs, and Hoary Hairs or Head, are promiſcuouſly taken in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for one and the ſame thing, as in

That Silver Crown of Hoary Hairs, which the Finger of God doth ſet upon the Head of Aged Perſons, doth render them Venerable, and to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced of all, even in all Places and Companies where they come: 'Twas a caution of Reſtraint in <hi>Rome, Cato Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det, &amp;c.</hi> much more <hi>Deus Videt, &amp;c.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that they (as it were) carry an awful Majeſty and Authority along with them, both for ſuppreſſing of Vice, and for encouraging of Vertue in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, (where too much familiarity, yea and too much folly with it, do not breed contempt.)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> the 2<hi>d</hi> This Crown is of the beſt kind of Crowns; 'tis not only a Crown of Silver, (as before) or a Crown of Gold, the beſt ſort of earthly Crowns, but 'tis a <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> and that in a double Kingdom, namely in the Kingdom of Grace here, (which is oft in Scripture<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48866:122"/>called Heaven,) and alſo in the Kingdom of Glory hereafter. So that ſuch Aged Perſons as are found to be God's <hi>Friends</hi> and Favourites, (as Old <hi>Abraham</hi> had that very Title given to him no fewer than three times of being <hi>God's Friend,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.7. Iſai. 41.8. and Jam. 2.23.) they ſhall have a double Crown of Glory, firſt in this Life, they ſhall have the Crown of Reverence and Veneration from all, as Old <hi>Abraham</hi> was thus Crowned, whom the very Heathens the <hi>Hittites</hi> moſt high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honoured, ſaying to him, [thou art a <hi>Prince of God,</hi> Hebr. or a Mighty Prince

<hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,</hi> and by <hi>Phicol</hi> the chief Captain of his Hoſt,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 21.22,23. where they (with all imaginable Reverence) make their moſt Humble Addreſs to Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he might make an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting League with them, and with their Poſterity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For both this King and his Captain, as alſo did the <hi>Hittites,</hi> all plainly ſee in <hi>him</hi> a behaviour that was more than ordinary to Mankind: They<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48866:122"/>were affraid of that Name of God, even that

<hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. and to be Conquerors alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37. they are
<hi>his</hi> Glory, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 4.5. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.23. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Crown of Glory is given to them, even in this World; and if we can but become faithful unto Death, then ſhall we have given us the Crown of Life in a better World, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. and we may the more have hope hereof, becauſe we are not kept by any power of our own, (which is no better than weakneſs it ſelf.) Tho' <hi>David</hi> ſaid, [I have kept my ſelf from mine Iniquity,] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.21,23. and the <hi>born of God keeps himſelf,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.19. but [<hi>we are kept by the power of God,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:48866:123"/>through faith, unto Salvation,</hi> and we <hi>are kept for Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Heaven is kept for us,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4,5. that we may receive the end of our Faith, even the <hi>ſalvation of our Souls,</hi> ver.
9. This great work of a double keeping, is wrought by the great Grace of God given freely to us, whereby we are <hi>made partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi>d Enquiry</hi> is, the <hi>Suppoſition,</hi> If we be

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To underſtand the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Phraſe, we muſt know, that it is not enough for us, to begin well, but we muſt end well alſo, [<hi>Exitus Acta probat,</hi>] 'tis the <hi>End that Crowns the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> The Old Father of the Church ſaith, ſome are
[<hi>Sancti Juvenes, ſed Satanici Senes,</hi>] Young Saints, yet at laſt prove no better than Old Devils; who begin in the Spirit but end in the Fleſh, as the Apoſtle's Phraſe is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Thoſe
<hi>fooliſh ones</hi> were like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Image, whoſe Golden Head ended in Dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Feet: They did <hi>Run well</hi> at the firſt, but the Devil hindred them in the way, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7. not only making them ſtop, and ſtep back, but alſo to ſtep aſide into <hi>crooked Paths,</hi> Pſal. 125.5. and <hi>ran a whoring</hi> from God,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. therefore the <hi>Lord will lead them ſorth with the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:48866:123"/>workers of iniquity:</hi> The doom of ſuch is denounced
[the <hi>backſlider in heart</hi> ſhall be filled <hi>with his own ways,</hi>] Prov. 14.14. As he hath made a match with Miſchief, ſo he ſhall ſoon have his Belly full of it; as he hath <hi>ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs,</hi> as <hi>Ahab</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.25. ſo he ſhall be ſure of a ſad Paiment at laſt. He hath <hi>drawn back unto perdition,</hi> and God ſaith, [<hi>My Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in you,</hi>] Heb. 10.37,38. Such as ſteal away from their Colours, run from their Captain, and revolt from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt expect no better than Martial Law; <hi>Apoſtates</hi> indeed are Renegadoes, they run away, but
'tis into the Mouth of Hell; ſo a worſe condition they cannot chooſe for themſelves: Whereas the Righteous (on the contrary) do <hi>hold on in their way,</hi> (both in their Youth, and in their Old Age,) and <hi>grow ſtronger</hi> and <hi>ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. He may indeed ſtumble ſometimes upon ſome Stumbling-ſtone or Block, that is laid in his way, as
<hi>David</hi> himſelf had his Stumbling-time, at the proſperity of the Wicked, and his own Adverſity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13,14,15. where we find his ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was ſo deep and dangerous, that he was ready to repent of his Repentance; but as he that ſtumbles, and falls not, gains ground by his ſtumbling in taking a<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48866:124"/>longer ſtride thereby, ſo did
<hi>David</hi> here, who upon ſecond thoughts, (ever better than the firſt) recoiling and reflecting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, ſaying, [<hi>this is my Infirmity,</hi>] and Oh how he be beaſts himſelf for ſo
<hi>ſtumbling!</hi> ver. 22. ſo <hi>fooliſh was I,</hi> and
<hi>Ignorant,</hi> and even <hi>as a Beaſt before thee,</hi> my God,] the Hebrew word for <hi>Beaſt</hi> is <hi>Behemoth;</hi> which is the plural feminine Hebrew, ſignifying a Big-bellied Beaſt, full of Young Ones, (which is a clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of <hi>Original Sin</hi> in us, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all Actual Sins,) and the ſame word [<hi>Behemoth</hi>] the Lord uſeth in his Humbling Speech to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 40.15, to 24: whereby is expreſſed, that Monſter of Beaſts, the Beaſt of Beaſts, the <hi>Elephant.</hi> By this (and by other Speeches of the ſame tendency) God ſo humbled
<hi>Job,</hi> as to make him [<hi>abhor himſelf,</hi> and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in</hi> Duſt and Aſhes,] <hi>Job</hi> 42.5. Thus likewiſe that Holy Man
<hi>Agur,</hi> who vilifies, yea nullifies himſelf to the utmoſt, ſaying,
[<hi>ſurely I am more brutiſh than any Man,</hi> and I have not the
<hi>underſtanding of a Man,</hi> &amp;c.] Prov. 30.2,3. Here was true
<hi>Humility,</hi> which is derived <hi>ab Humo,</hi> ſignifying the
<hi>Ground,</hi> becauſe this Grace lays us flat on the ground; thus theſe godly perſons (and many more upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-record) did indeed ſtumble
<hi>in the<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48866:124"/>way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> yea and ſome of them very <hi>fouly,</hi> yet none of them did ſo ſtumble, as to fall finally from that bleſſed way; they all did recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by Repentance, they all did return to this way of Righteouſneſs; and they all did perſevere therein to their dying day: So their <hi>Gray Hairs</hi> became a <hi>Crown of Glory</hi> to them, being all <hi>found in the way of Righteouſneſs, Note well,</hi> we muſt all be found in that way, when both Old Age and Death alſo come to find us. Old Father
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſaid, [<hi>Canities tunc Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerabilis eſt, quando ea gerit quae caniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em decent,</hi> to wit, then is Old Age moſt worthily Venerable, then is Hoarineſs of Hairs moſt truly Honourable, when only ſuch Deeds are done by it, that doth well become it both in the ſight of God and Men: We Old Ones ought to make it our <hi>exerciſe</hi> which the bleſſed Apoſtle made his, ſaying, [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

Oh that we could make this ſame our Exerciſe, yea even our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation</hi> both Night and Day; uſing our utmoſt Diligence, Skill, Will and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſciplining and inuring our ſelves herein, and thereby we ſhall neither be<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48866:125"/>
               <hi>aſhamed to live,</hi> nor <hi>affraid to die.</hi> We muſt live (as that Apoſtle did) <hi>in all good Conſcience,</hi> Acts 23.1.
<hi>Good,</hi> both with the goodneſs of <hi>Integrity,</hi> and with the goodneſs of <hi>Tranquility;</hi> we muſt keep our Conſciences clear and clean, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offend all the World, yea all the <hi>Witches</hi> in the World, than offend our own Conſciences; for <hi>Conſcience</hi> is <hi>God's Spie,</hi> and 'tis Man's Overſeer; as it is God's Deputy-Judge, ſo it is Man's Domeſtick Chaplain, bearing witneſs of all our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and deſirings; and accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing or accuſing, abſolving or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; yea comforting or tormenting us: And [if our own <hi>Hearts</hi> (or Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) do <hi>condemn us,</hi> God is <hi>greater than our Hearts,</hi> and will condemn us <hi>much more,</hi>] 1 John. 3.20. Whereas on the contrary, when Hoary Hairs are not found in the way of Righteouſneſs, that Hoari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is ſo far from being Honourable, that 'tis rather
<hi>Mucor</hi> than <hi>Canities,</hi> a naſty Mouldineſs, and not a venerable Hoarineſs.

<hi>having Eyes</hi>
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:48866:125"/>full of Adultery, and that cannot ceaſe from ſin, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gray Hairs and Green Thoughts make an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agreement, ſuch are Heteroclites in declining Nature, and Monſters of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the World; in whom it is ſo far gone with them, and Luſt hath ſuch an unlimited power over them, that neither
<hi>ſtrength of Grace,</hi> as Gen. 39.9. in Young <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſtrong Grace kept him from that great wickedneſs and ſin againſt his God: nor <hi>decays</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> can reſtrain them from their Youthful Extravagancy, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaid, (after I am old, ſhall Huſt,) old and cold is our Engliſh Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb. It was the aggravation of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſin that he was in his Old Age ſo eaſily drawn away from God and godlineſs by his Idolatrous Wives, 1
<hi>Kings</hi> 11.4. Oh how ridiculous it is to behold a ſinner, a Child of
<hi>Fourſcore</hi> or an hundred years old! yet ſuch ſhameful ſights as theſe are denounced <hi>accurſed,</hi> Iſa. 65.20. But if we indeed be the true Sons and Daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we ought to do what he did, of whom it is ſaid, that he <hi>went to his Grave in a good Old Age,</hi> or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it, with a <hi>good Gray Head,</hi> Gen. 25.8. We muſt imitate him in this herein, even all we that are Old, that we may be
<hi>Good</hi> as well as <hi>Old,</hi> that we may<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48866:126"/>both Live and and Die in a <hi>good Old Age</hi> as he did; for unleſs we walk in
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s ſteps in this World while we live, we can never expect to lodge in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom when we die. <hi>Abraham died an Old Man and full of Years,</hi> Gen. 25.8. He was as fully ſatisfied to leave the World, as men are wont to be willing to riſe from the Table, when ſatisfied to the full with Food: And thus <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>I would not live always,</hi> Job 7.16. but more of this after. It was the ſaying of
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Caeſar,</hi> (that Great Emperor, in whoſe Reign our
<hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> was born) <hi>Audite me Senem vos Juvenes, quem Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venem multi Senes audierunt,</hi> be pleaſed, Oh ye Young Men, to hearken diligently unto me, who am now Old, whom many Old Men did hear attentively when I was but Young. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have been Young, and now am Old; come ye Children, hearken to me, and I will teach you the fear of the Loed,</hi> Pſal. 34.11. and 37.25. Accordingly, I ſay in all humbleneſs of Soul, Oh that all People (both Young and Old) may lend an hearing Ear to me who am now very Old, whom all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of all Ages did ſavingly hearken to, when I was Young; ſo that the Lord by his Grace made me a Spiritual Father to many Souls both Young and Old, Male<pb n="243" facs="tcp:48866:126"/>and Female, Rich and Poor, yea Bond and Free, <hi>All theſe are one in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Col.
3.11. whom I have begotten in the Goſpel, (as the Apoſtle doth phraſe it,) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. who all riſe up and call me their <hi>Spiritual Father in Chriſt;</hi> amongſt whom there is one remarkable Paſſage I cannot but record, which indeed is worthy to be kept in everlaſting remembrance, namely, While I was Miniſter at <hi>Cottingham</hi> near
<hi>Hull,</hi> that Miniſterial Charge being reſigned over to me by Famous Dr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> when he went over into <hi>Ireland</hi> to be the Provoſt of the College at <hi>Dublin,</hi>) there it pleaſed the Lord ſo to bleſs my Miniſtry, as to honour me with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of many Souls, both in that place, and in other places round about. But above all, there was one <hi>Thomas Raſpin,</hi> an Old Man, and one of the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Men in that great Town, who (through grace) had moſt evidently and moſt eminently a new work of Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wrought upon his heart in his Old Age, and when Gray Hairs were upon him, which indeed made him a moſt lively Servant of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his dying day, <hi>bringing forth ſreſh Fruit in his Old Age,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 92.14. whoſe Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon I then preached, wherein I obſerved what a rare work of God this was to be<pb n="244" facs="tcp:48866:127"/>effectually called in our Old Age; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in the New Teſtament, who were both called home from Idolatry, and from Ignorance, when they were Old Men: And very few more ſuch Inſtances can be found out upon Record in either Teſtament. Now ſeeing this ſignal and ſingular Favour of God was vouchſafed to ſuch a worthleſs Worm as me, about fifty years ago, when I had been but about ſeven years employed in the work of the Miniſtry; if the Lord was then pleaſed to cauſe Old Perſons ſo ſavingly to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto my Miniſterial Voice, while I was ſo Young; how much more may I hope now, that all Perſons of all Ages will give their moſt diligent Attention un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that moſt weighty Advice, (for I cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially profeſs to ſpeak no otherwiſe than as an <hi>Oracle of God,</hi> unto all Aged ones, which cannot prove unſeaſonable to any that are Young; becauſe, if the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them to lengthen out their Lives, (and not <hi>cut them off for</hi> their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the <hi>midſt of their days,</hi> Pſal. 55.23.) they muſt come to be Aged alſo: And therefore let all lend an hearing Ear unto that grave Counſel which I (an Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt) doth declare at this time to you in the Name of the Lord. We<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48866:127"/>are told how <hi>Moſes</hi> was fourſcore Years Old when God ſent him with God's Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 7.7. to ſhew, that the words of an Old Meſſenger of God ought to take a deep impreſſion upon the Hearts of all Hearers, in caſe they be not Caſe-hardened as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was, over and over again, both by himſelf, and by God, and likewiſe by the Devil. But I hope this is not the Caſe of any of you, (as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9.) tho' I mention the Caſe of
<hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Now I who am very near Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore may likewiſe ſay,
[<hi>I am perſuaded better things of you, tho' I thus ſpeak.</hi>] 'Twas
<hi>Zuinglius</hi> his practice, when he had been inveighing againſt Vice, to come off with theſe ſoft words, [<hi>Probe Vir, hoc nihil ad te,</hi>] this is nothing to thee, Oh thou Honeſt Man. So my preſent proſpect through Grace is, that I may prevail with many, either to haſten into, or to keep cloſe in the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, if in it already; <hi>how forcible are right words,</hi> Job 6.25. eſpecially to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Hearts, more eſpecially when <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Days and Years doth teach Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</hi> Job 32.7. I have made a long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in diſcovering the many Characters of the <hi>true Conquerors through the Love of Chriſt.</hi> Now ſeeing every Conqueror doth win a Crown, which hath this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48866:128"/>upon it, [<hi>Vincenti Dabo, to him that overcometh, will I give it,</hi> Rev. 2.7,10,26. and 3.5,21. and 21.7. but my preſent Task is to ſhew ſome Inſtances of ſuch Conquerors, to wit, ſuch Aged Ones as are found in the <hi>way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the Crown of Life, the Crown of Glory ſhall be aſſuredly ſet and ſeated upon their Hoary Heads. After the general Diſcourſe upon this Subject aforeſaid, that all us Aged Perſons may come both to win and wear this bleſſed Crown, I ſhall ſpeak more particularly upon that <hi>Theme</hi> of <hi>Old Age,</hi> concerning its <hi>Nature</hi> and its <hi>Accidents,</hi> and concerning thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> which ought to attend it, whereby it may be made (like
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s aforeſaid) <hi>a good Old Age,</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis ſaid to the honour of <hi>Young Men,</hi> that

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> of the 1<hi>ſt</hi> of theſe, namely, its
<hi>Nature, Old Age</hi> is, without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, a real Bleſſing of God, in, and of it ſelf, otherwiſe God would never have made it the matter of this exceeding great and pretious Promiſe, which he was pleaſed to annex to the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, [<hi>Honour thy Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:48866:128"/>that thy days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,] <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
6.2,3. This Duty of Children to obey their Parents in the Lord, the Apoſtle calls it a <hi>Right Duty,</hi> Epheſ. 6.1. and commends it moreover as a Duty, not only <hi>good before Men,</hi> but <hi>acceptable alſo unto God,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.4. This Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is called the <hi>Firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Promiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 6.2. that is, the Firſt Affirmative Commandment, or the Firſt in the Second Table, or the Firſt of all the Ten, with ſuch a Special Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Long Life in the Land of the Living, [<hi>that thou maiſt</hi> live long,] Epheſ. 6.3. As good Children do help to leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their Parents days, (ſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> did
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s &amp;c.) So God for encouraging them in their Duty, doth promiſe to lengthen their Days; and if at any time God take this Long Leaſe from them here, he grants them a <hi>Freehold-Eſtate</hi> of a greater Value hereafter. If God do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to give them the <hi>Silver</hi> of a Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life in this lower World, he will be ſure to pay them moſt plentifully with the
<hi>Gold</hi> of an Eternal Life in the upper and better World; whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſuch as are ſtubborn and undutiful Children, as they ſhorten their Parents<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48866:129"/>Lives, and bring down their Gray Hairs with ſorrow to their Graves: So God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth ſhorten the Lives of ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Children, and cuts them off in the midſt of their Days, as God did to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abimelech,</hi> of whom it is ſaid, that <hi>the Lord</hi> rendred <hi>upon him the Evil which he had done unto his Father Gideon,</hi> Judg. 9.56. Yea, and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, [the Eve that mocketh at his Father, (as curſed <hi>Cham</hi> did at <hi>Noah</hi>) and deſpiſeth to
<hi>obey his Mother,</hi> the Ravens of the Vally ſhall pick out that mocking Eye,] <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.17. God takes notice of the offending Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and appoints this Puniſhment for it, and a ſad one too; if this be underſtood of the Infernal-Ravens, thoſe Black De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of Hell, thoſe are curſed with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whom the Holy Ghoſt thus curſeth with ſuch emphatical expreſſions, and in ſuch exquiſite Terms: Thoſe Ravens of the Vally are ſaid to be moſt ravenous, and the firſt thing they do to a Carcaſe, is to pick out the Eyes, as <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith,
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Effoſſos Oculos Voret Atro Guttare Corvus.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> adds to the ſaying of
<hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> [He that curſeth Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let him die the Death,] <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.4. All this does make it manifeſt,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48866:129"/>that as a ſhort Life is a Curſe, ſo a long Life is a Bleſſing; otherwiſe as on the one hand <hi>Godlineſs</hi> would never have left to it by the Lord, ſo many precious <hi>Promiſes,</hi> as theſe, (to name but a few of the many) beſide the afore-named.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) God promiſeth to his people (1.) [<hi>That he will fulfil the number of their days,</hi>] Exod. 23.26. that is, they ſhall dye
<hi>full of days</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 25.8. as <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen.
35.29. and as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 Chron. 29.28. They all did fall like full-ripe Apples into the hands of God the right Owner, and the great Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of them.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That [<hi>He will take away Sickneſs from them,</hi>] Deut 7.15. that is, he will beſtow the great bleſſing of Health upon them, which is the beſt of Temporal Bleſſings; for a ſickly Life is a lifeleſs Life, and no better than a lingring Death: <hi>Non eſt Vivere, ſed Valere, Vita,</hi> ſaith <hi>Martial,</hi> Health is the Reward of Piety, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That [they ſhall be <hi>bleſſed in the</hi> City, and bleſſed in the Country, <hi>bleſſed</hi> every where,]
<hi>Deut.</hi> 28.2,3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mercy and goodneſs follows them all the days of their Lives, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of himſelf,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.6. as before he had ſaid, [he <hi>asked Life of thee,</hi> and thou <hi>gaveſt it<pb n="250" facs="tcp:48866:130"/>him,</hi> even
<hi>length</hi> of Days, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 21.4. and he deſcribing the State of a godly Man in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91. he reckons up the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power of God in preſerving his Perſon from manifold Calamities, ſo far as it conſiſts with God's Glory, and the godly Man's good; yea tho' he die of the Plague, (for the beſt are not exempted from common Calamities) yet ſhall he be ſaved from the plague of the Plague, and with <hi>long Life will I ſatisfie him,</hi> Pſal. 91.16.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Another Divine Promiſe is, [<hi>cleave unto the Lord,</hi> for <hi>He is thy Life,</hi> and the <hi>length of thy Days.</hi>] Deut. 30.20. Agreeable unto this is, that Godly Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhall add both length of Days and a long Life, and Peace unto ſuch as are bleſt with it,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.2. an thus God told wiſe <hi>Solomon,</hi> [ſeeing thou haſt not asked long Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Wiſdom of me, yet if thou wilt keep my Commands, I will <hi>add length of Days</hi> to thee,] 1 King.
3.11,14. Many more Promiſes of along Life might be added, but to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity this ſhall ſuffice, adding only that length of Days is a tranſcendent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and deſirable in general by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. This was <hi>David's</hi> Doctrine, which he proclaimeth with a challenge to the whole World, crying (as it were) with ſound of Trumpet, [<hi>What Man is he that<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48866:130"/>deſireth Life, and loveth many days that he may ſee Good,</hi>] Pſal. 34.12. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> brings all ſorts of Mortal Men and Women, who all unanimouſly anſwered to <hi>David</hi>'s Queſtion, ſaying with much eagerneſs, every one for themſelves,
[<hi>Ego &amp; Ego,</hi>] <hi>I would,</hi> and <hi>I would,</hi> &amp;c. All Perſons do deſire a long Life, many hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Days, and a comfortable Enjoyment of all: But alas how few there be, that take right Courſes to obtain the true Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to that wholeſom Counſel which
<hi>David</hi> doth preſcribe for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of it, <hi>ver.</hi>
13, 14, 15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> What a bleſſing is <hi>long Life,</hi> may be farther demonſtrated by the many direful Threatnings which the Lord hath denounced againſt wickedneſs, (as before his pretious Promiſes to Godlineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that the Wicked ſhall not live out half his days, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.24. and in many more Scriptures too long here to relate, all ſhewing that a ſhort Life is a curſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet know that in ſome caſes it is a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as to thoſe who are
<hi>taken away from the evil to come,</hi> 1 King. 14.13. and Iſai. 57.1. Juſt as when a Fire breaks forth in an Houſe, then Men carry forth their Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but God conveys his Cabinet into a better World, their Souls enter into Reſt and paſs to Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:48866:131"/>The Concluſion of this 1<hi>ſt</hi>
               <hi>Point</hi> then is this, That ſeeing a <hi>long Life</hi> is
<hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> by the <hi>Lord</hi> to the Godly, and <hi>ſhort Life</hi> is threatned by <hi>Him</hi> to the Wicked, therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow from theſe two aforenamed premiſes, that a good Old Age, and to <hi>go the Grave full of Years,</hi> and full of Graces as well as Years, (as <hi>Abraham</hi> did) is a great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God as to its own
<hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Subſtance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The 2<hi>d Point</hi> I have to diſcourſe upon, is the
<hi>Accidents</hi> of this <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of Old Age, which are principally <hi>two,</hi> namely, (1<hi>ſt</hi>) The
<hi>Quantity;</hi> and (2dly) The <hi>Quality</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Concerning the <hi>Quantity</hi> of it, and this is twofold.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt</hi> That which was more <hi>ſpecial</hi> and peculiar to the <hi>Antedeluvian Patriarchs.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="2">(2<hi>dly</hi>) That which is moſt General and Univerſal to all the <hi>Poſt-diluvian</hi> generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mankind ever ſince
<hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, not only unto this day, but alſo to the end of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt</hi> As to the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> They indeed lived very long, and to a very great Old Age, yet they all did die at laſt; for the God of Nature did ordain, (upon the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) that Nature ſhould decay<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48866:131"/>and die at laſt. <hi>NB. Note well,</hi> That none of the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> did live out com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly a Thouſand Years; for that term of Time is reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

[<hi>in the Day, thou eateſt the forbidden Fruit, thou ſhalt ſurely Die,</hi>] Gen. 2.17. Now if any one of thoſe had lived beyond a Thouſand Years, then Man had not died within the compaſs of that Myſtical Day,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Patriarchs</hi> indeed had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large Quantity, and a long Leaſe of their Lives; and this was for many weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Reaſons,</hi> of four ſeveral ſorts: (1.) <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</hi> (2.)
<hi>Civil.</hi> (3.) <hi>Moral.</hi> (4.) <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical.</hi>

And indeed this is the indiſpenſable Duty, not only of ſuch as are Old, but 'tis neceſſary for all that are Young to do ſo likewiſe, becauſe this Quantity, and the length of the Lives of all Perſons, in all Ages, is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the Proverb ſaith, as ſoon goes the Lambs Skin to the Market, as that of the Old Sheep; the

<hi>Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Lepidus</hi> was deſtroyed by a light bruiſe upon his Toe. Many ſuch Stories I might relate, of this Nature; but to be ſhort, let me add only one more, which I can both affirm and confirm upon my own knowledge, that a great Lord of this Land, (who was my Patron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) that was brought to his Death, only by paring a Corn upon his Toe, which did after Gangreen, and ſtruck upwards, whereof at laſt he died. All theſe
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances</hi> (with many more which might be added) do demonſtrate the <hi>uncertainty</hi> of our Lives, as there is nothing more
<hi>certain</hi> than our Deaths, (for that is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the great Statute of Heaven, that <hi>all Men muſt once die,</hi> Heb. 9.27.) yet as to the time of it, there is nothing more <hi>uncertain,</hi> eſpecially conſidering [how <hi>Man is deſtroyed from Morning to Evening,</hi>] Job
4.20. the Hebrew reading is, he is <hi>beaten to pieces as in a Mortar,</hi> with one Miſery upon another, until the very Breath be beaten out of his Body at length;<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48866:136"/>yea and all this <hi>from Morning to Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that is, not only all the day long, but even all the <hi>life long;</hi> which is here (for its brevity) compared to an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Day, and ſuch as no Man can be ſure he <hi>ſhall have twelve hours to his Day:</hi> For how many are there, whoſe Sun hath ſet at High-noon, even in the prime and pride of their Days they have been ſnatcht away by the Hand of Death; yea, yet higher, how many do we ſee whoſe <hi>Sun</hi> doth ſet at its very riſing; ſo that they are carried from the Grave of the Womb, to the Womb of the Grave, even from their <hi>Birth</hi> to their <hi>Burial:</hi> And aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we all every Hour, as well as every Day, do yield ſomewhat unto Death, and nearer and nearer do we approach to our latter end; yea and the longeſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of us hath but a ſhort cut from the firſt Riſing of our Sun, to its laſt Setting, from our Birth to our Burial: The
<hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> ſaith, that [the <hi>Sun knoweth the time of its going down,</hi>] Pſal. 104.19. But this cannot be ſaid of any of the Sons of Men, that they know the time of their going down to the Grave; good
<hi>Iſaac</hi> knew it not, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.1,2. (except only
<hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who by a ſpecial diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation from God, knew it;) much leſs can we, that are old, know the time of<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48866:136"/>our going down, or the Quantity of our Old Age. The Jewiſh Rabbins do men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion three Steps or Degrees in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Old Age; the firſt they call
[<hi>Senes,</hi>] the ſecond they name [<hi>Annoſi</hi>] and the third they ſtile [<hi>Decrepidi;</hi>] and thus they reckon, when a Man comes to be Sixty Years old, ſuch an one they reckon'd to be reached only to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Old Age, paſſing along until he ſtepped on unto Seventy Years of Age, at which Age <hi>David</hi> died, ſee after: Then <hi>Secondly,</hi> They accounted him among the <hi>Annoſos,</hi> an Old Man indeed, who lived up from Seventy to Eighty Years of Age; ſuch a Man was got a great way into that far Country of Old Age, even into that Hyperborean cold and frozen Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, where the Snow of Hoary Hairs lay continually upon his Head undiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The higheſt Step and Degree, is ſuch an one as liveth above Eighty Years old; thoſe they number among <hi>Decrepid</hi> Ones, that then are Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated, declining to a Doteage, in whom all the Senſes of the Body, yea, and all the Faculties of the Soul begin daily to decay, (as in Old <hi>Barzillai</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-named, according to his own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto
<hi>David;</hi>) ſuch very Aged Perſons are accounted <hi>wondrous Old,</hi> as is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48866:137"/>in the Old Singing Pſalms, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. for it falls out moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, that in this wondrous Old Age, we pay the deep intereſt of Pains in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous Diſtempers, being the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith) we <hi>can have no Pleaſure,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.1,2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Old <hi>Adage,</hi> [<hi>bis Pueri Senes</hi>] Old Perſons are twice Children; as after their Birth, ſo before their Death they become meerly
<hi>Childiſh,</hi> which once did occaſion my ſelf to ſay, when I ſaw a very Old Woman, (one paſt all other Work (rocking the Cradle, that had a very Young Babe in it, behold, <hi>there is one Child rocking another;</hi> and thereupon I gave her the beſt advice I could, how it was high time for her to make ſure work for a better World. Moreover, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this Rabinical Animadverſion thus Spiritually Improved, we have another more Critical and Chriſtian Calculation of Man's Life, made by one of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<hi>Martyrs,</hi> who left behind this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Criticiſm, ſaying,
[becauſe the common term of Humane Life, in the ordinary courſe of Nature, is but <hi>Threeſcore Years and Ten,</hi> according to <hi>Moſes</hi> (that Man of God's) computation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.10. Now if we divide thoſe Seventy Years into four Equal Parts, then muſt it neceſſarily
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48866:137"/>follow, that every Man is three parts Dead, when he doth but arrive at the Age of Fifty Years. This ſolid Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth much ſooner mind us of our Mortality, than that before of the Jewiſh
<hi>Rabbins;</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe I my ſelf have (both publickly and privately) taught the like Leſſon upon the end of my four Fingers and the Thumb, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eyes of thoſe I ſpake to, how the top of the little Finger repreſents our Childhood, the top of the next Finger ſhews our Youth, the top of the longeſt Finger demonſtrates our Middle Age, when we come to our <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, or fulneſs of Height and Health; then the top of the fore Finger, (which is a little lower than the middle Finger) declares our beginning to decline by little and little; but laſtly from the top of the fore Finger to the top of the Thumb there is a great fall, and hence is it that we uſually ſay, ſuch an Aged Perſon breaks faſt in a little time; the Lord help us to learn this Leſſon upon our Fingers ends. <hi>NB. Note well,</hi> The God of Nature hath ordained, that Nature in all his created Beings muſt decay; yet this is the Sovereign Power of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor over all his Creatures to determine the Time, meaſure and Quantity, when the period of Nature ſhall come to decay,<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48866:138"/>and be diſſolved. Thus <hi>Job</hi> acknowledges this Divine Rule and Dominion of God over all Mankind, ſaying, [<hi>his Days are determined,</hi> the <hi>number of his Months</hi> are <hi>with God;</hi> thou haſt appointed his Bounds that he cannot paſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]
<hi>Job</hi> 14.5,6. that is, God hath ſet every Man the Bounds of <hi>his Time,</hi> (whether <hi>ſhorter</hi>) called here [his Days] or longer, [the
<hi>number of his Months;</hi>] and whether ſhorter or longer, they have both their Bounds which they cannot paſs, no more than the unruly <hi>Ocean</hi> can <hi>paſs the Bounds</hi> that its <hi>Maker hath ſet it,</hi> Job
38.8,9,10,11. We ſhould think the ſame of the Waters of Afflictions that the Lord doth limit them, ſaying, [<hi>thus far ſhalt thou go, and no ſarther,</hi> and here <hi>ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtaid.</hi>] This Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Rule and Dominion of God over Man, in determining his Time upon Earth, is made manifeſt, in ordering ſuch long Leaſes of Life to the
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> and ſuch a ſhort Term to the Lives of the following Ages: This is elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed thus by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> [<hi>Vitae Jugera illis, ſed nobis tantum Spithamas Deus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit illi Gigantes fuere, nos vero Pugio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, &amp;c.</hi>] God gave to the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> whole and
<hi>long Acres</hi> of Life, but to us only a Span-breadth thereof; they were
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48866:138"/>lofty Gyants, but we are puny Dwarfs; yea, and this Divine Dominion is daily apparent, as the only over-ruling Reaſon why ſome,
<hi>likely to live long,</hi> do die ſoon; while others that are more weak with daily Diſtempers, do live longer than they; as well as it is the Will and Wiſdom of God, that we ſee the Sons and Daughters of Men do die daily in all Ages, in Childhood, Youth, Middle Age, as well as Old Age: And as God hath ſet Bounds to <hi>Man's Time,</hi> ſo hath he determined <hi>Man's Task</hi> likewiſe; thus <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had his <hi>Courſe to fulfil,</hi> Acts 13.25. the word for <hi>Courſe</hi> in Greek is [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<hi>Herod,</hi> yet he lived much in a little ſpace; he wrought hard, and made haſte in his Work, as not willing to be taken with his Task undone. Thus
'tis ſaid of <hi>David</hi> alſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.36. that he
<hi>ſerved out his Generation,</hi> and then he <hi>fell aſleep</hi> after he had done his <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work</hi> according to the <hi>will of God.</hi> There is an <hi>appointed time to Man upon the Earth,</hi> Job 7.1. both for his <hi>Time,</hi> and for his <hi>Task;</hi> and he who bears up the Heavens, preſcribes ſuch a <hi>Pillar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="268" facs="tcp:48866:139"/>Man, (with this Inſcription writ upon it, [<hi>ne plus ultra</hi>] thou ſhalt <hi>paſs no farther:</hi> [<hi>ſtat ſua cuique dies</hi>] ſaid <hi>Virgil</hi> of old, every Man hath his Day ſet him wherein he muſt die, his laſt Day ſtands, but all the reſt of his days to that Day are in a running poſture.

<hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>like Paſſions as we are,</hi> Acts 14.15. Jam. 5.17. It is a ſinful deſire for any who would be gone to
<hi>Heaven,</hi> before their Work<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48866:141"/>be done <hi>on Earth;</hi> we muſt rather ſay, [<hi>O Father,</hi> if thou haſt any further Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for me to do, I am willing to live longer, <hi>&amp;c. the Will of the Lord be done,</hi> Acts 21.14.</p>
            <p>Having thus far diſcourſed upon the firſt <hi>Accident</hi> of <hi>Old Age,</hi> (after its <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>) namely, the <hi>Quantity</hi> or Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of it, which we have obſerved to be <hi>Uncertain</hi> and
<hi>Various,</hi> either <hi>long</hi> or <hi>ſhort,</hi> according to the
<hi>Statute-law</hi> of the great <hi>Law-giver,</hi> the <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> &amp;c. [who hath <hi>appointed all men once to die,</hi> &amp;c.] Heb. 9.27. even <hi>Methuſalem,</hi> (who was the longeſt liver, upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-record, and who came the neareſt to be a <hi>Thouſand</hi> Years Old, which is recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a number of perfection, never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to by any mere man.) Tho' he lived many Hundred Years, even near to a <hi>Thouſand,</hi> and
<hi>begat Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> yet he died at the laſt; ſee my firſt
<hi>Volume</hi> of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the
<hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> at large.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the <hi>Second Accident</hi> of <hi>Old Age,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Quality</hi> or Manner of it, which is either <hi>Good</hi> or
<hi>Evil.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>firſt,</hi> How it is a <hi>good Old Age</hi> in its own Nature, and by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon it, I have already demonſtrated in the foregoing Diſcourſe; and I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48866:141"/>to enlarge much more upon that Point, when I arrive at the Third Part, (after its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Accidents</hi>) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the <hi>Dues</hi> to, and the <hi>Duties</hi> of <hi>Aged Ones,</hi> whereby
<hi>Old Age</hi> may become <hi>good</hi> indeed.</p>
            <p>Now as touching the latter of theſe two, That <hi>Old Age</hi> is an <hi>Evil Age,</hi> that <hi>Senium &amp; Malum convertuntur:</hi> Theſe two are convertible Terms; <hi>Solomon</hi> the Wiſe doth ſufficiently evince and evidence, in <hi>his</hi> ſaying, [<hi>Oh, Young Ones, remember your Creator, before Evil Days come, and the Years draw nigh, wherein you ſhall ſay, I have no pleaſure in them,</hi>] Eccleſ. 12.1. Wherein he begins to deſcribe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The weariſom <hi>evils of Old Age,</hi> from the latter end of <hi>ver.</hi> 1. to the laſt end of <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Of the evils of Death, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. both which he brings in as <hi>two ſtrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> to urge Young ones to be mindful of their <hi>Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, <hi>Firſt</hi> in the <hi>General,</hi> All
<hi>Authors,</hi> both thoſe that be <hi>Civil,</hi> as well as thoſe that be <hi>Sacred,</hi> do unanimouſly concur in this point, That <hi>Old Age</hi> and <hi>Miſery</hi> are very ſeldom found ſeparated. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <hi>Senectus ut Africa ſemper aliquid Novi adportat,</hi> as <hi>Affrica</hi> is never without ſome Monſter, ſo <hi>Old<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48866:142"/>Age</hi> is never without ſome <hi>Ailment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2). <hi>Cato</hi> ſaith, [<hi>Solet Senectus eſſe, Deformis, Infirma, Oblivioſa, Edulenta, Lucroſa, Indocilis &amp; Moleſta,</hi>] that is, Old Age uſeth to be Deformed, Feeble, Forgetful, Toothleſs, Covetous, Unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Unquiet.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith, [<hi>Multa Senem cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumveniunt Incommoda,</hi>] Many are the Inconveniencies that do encompaſs Old Perſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith in his Epiſtle 58. and that out of his own Experience, [<hi>How are our laſt Days the very Dregs and Lees of our Lives,</hi>] when the clearer part is drawn out and ſpent, then the worſt part does ſink down to the bottom.</p>
            <p>To add no more of <hi>Pagan Authors,</hi> ſave only
<hi>Epictetus,</hi> (5.) calls <hi>Old Age,</hi> [<hi>Vita Mors, Cadaver Spirans, &amp; Mobile Cadaver,</hi>] that is, Old Age is a Living Death, 'tis a Breathing Corps, yea a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Carcaſe.</p>
            <p>Now hear what <hi>Sacred Authors</hi> ſay better than thoſe aforeſaid, is too long to quote together in this place, ſeeing ſo much hath been ſhewed hereof already. The <hi>Book</hi> of our own ſmarting
<hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> ſpeak loud enough to convince us of the <hi>Evil</hi> of <hi>Old Age.</hi> How many Bodily Infirmities doth daily attend us that are
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48866:142"/>Aged, what <hi>Aches</hi> of the Bones, what
<hi>Pains</hi> in the Joints, what <hi>Convulſions</hi> of the Sinews, what
<hi>Torments</hi> of the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; how dolorous are thoſe Diſeaſes of
<hi>Collick, Stone</hi> and <hi>Strangury</hi> in Old Perſons; what
<hi>Hollow Coughs, Diſtillations</hi> of <hi>Rhume,</hi> what
<hi>Debility</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaches daily upon all our Senſes of Body, and upon all the Faculties of the Mind, our Appetites to Food, our Digeſtions of Food both feeble; ſo that in a word, <hi>Old Age</hi> is like the <hi>Common-Sewer,</hi> into which all Diſeaſes do empty themſelves; and therefore <hi>Old Age</hi> may well be called an <hi>Evil Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> After this General, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the, The
<hi>Evils</hi> of <hi>Old Age</hi> may be reduced to <hi>Three Heads,</hi> to wit, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>ſt</hi>) The <hi>Evils</hi> that are
<hi>Natural</hi> to it. And (1.) As to the <hi>Body,</hi> Many Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers do attend it, as thoſe even now na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and many more beſide, whereof
<hi>Barzillai</hi> complained, as before, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.34,35. All Aged Perſons do ſmartly feel the Burden of it, as that ancient Woman in
<hi>Plautus,</hi> who being wiſhed by her Friends (that were walking along with her) to haſten and amend her pace, ſmartly
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nſwered, that ſhe could not do ſo, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he carried a great Burden upon her Back; <pb n="276" facs="tcp:48866:143"/>and when no Burden did (as they ſaid) appear to their Eyes, ſhe replied again, that <hi>Threeſcore Years</hi> were paſſed over her Head, and that was her <hi>Burden.</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid by thoſe, whoſe Spirits are much ſpent, and whoſe Strength is much waſted even at that Age; for then <hi>Age</hi> it ſelf alone is a <hi>Burden,</hi> much more in thoſe that live up even to a
<hi>Doteage</hi> and <hi>Uſeleſneſs.</hi> This is made more manifeſt by
<hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. where he declares the Decays accompanying Old Age; he ſaith according to our <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation,</hi> [then the
<hi>Graſhopper ſhall be a Burden,</hi>] ver. 5. but the original word, Hebrew, ſignifies [the <hi>curvature</hi> or <hi>crookedneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Back,</hi> which in Old Perſons ſtands bent like a
<hi>Graſhopper;</hi> and this makes the motions of ſuch as are crooked with Age to be the more burdenſome, or the <hi>Phraſe</hi> there is
<hi>Hyperbolical,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that every light matter will oppreſs thoſe with their Burden, who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy become a Burden to themſelves: And beſide this <hi>Natural Evil</hi> of Old Age, as to the <hi>Body,</hi> there is a <hi>ſecond</hi> as to the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> many
<hi>Loſſes</hi> and <hi>Croſſes</hi> do come upon them; as the loſs of ſome of their neareſt and deareſt Relations, and ſuch like, complaining as Old <hi>Jacob</hi> did, [who mourned for his <hi>loſt Son many days,</hi> and<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48866:143"/>
               <hi>refuſed to be Comforted,</hi>] Gen.
37.34,35. and again, [<hi>Joſeph is not,</hi> and <hi>Simeon is not,</hi> and muſt I loſe my dear <hi>Benjamin</hi> too, as he had loſt
<hi>Rachel,</hi> &amp;c? Gen. 42.36. Tho' <hi>Jacob</hi>'s mourning was only for <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed loſſes,</hi> yet he had <hi>real ones</hi> alſo, as of his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> &amp;c. Many more inſtances may be mentioned, as of <hi>David</hi> mourning for the <hi>real loſs</hi> of his Son
<hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolom,</hi> for whom he made ſo deep a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> This loſs of Relations is the greater <hi>Natural Evil,</hi> becauſe it is againſt the courſe of Nature for Parents to bury Children, whereas Children uſe to bury Parents, for one Generation paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, when another cometh; ſo that a Generation of Children doth (as it were) thruſt out of the World a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Parents by Natures Law. To all this let me add my own exerciſe with this Evil, who have lived to bury <hi>eight Children</hi> out of <hi>nine,</hi> &amp;c. And yet there is a <hi>third Natural Evil</hi> attending <hi>Old Age,</hi> as to their reſpect and reverence from the Younger Sort; alas, how are they as <hi>Lamps deſpiſed,</hi> as <hi>Old Job</hi> complains, <hi>Job</hi> 12.4,5. and more fully <hi>Job</hi> 19.15,16,17,18. and 30.1, to 11, 12, 13. where he ſighs out theſe ſad words, ſaying, [<hi>Upon my Right Hand riſe the Young, they puſh away my Feet,</hi> &amp;c.] which explaineth what he had ſaid,
<hi>ver.</hi> 1.<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48866:144"/>that <hi>Younger</hi> than he was, did not only <hi>deride him,</hi> and <hi>laughed him to ſcorn,</hi> (tho' they were no better than <hi>Shagrag Dog-keepers,</hi> as he calls them, and moſt miſerably poor, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.) Yet theſe <hi>Young Scoundrils</hi> dared to <hi>kick him with their Feet,</hi> or trip up his Heels to lay him along. <hi>Job</hi> was wont to have the chiefeſt Seats in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and lowly Salutations in the <hi>Market-place:</hi> He was now <hi>Ancient,</hi> and had been <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable,</hi> as he had ſet forth at large in <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. but here he bewails his Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he cannot have a Room in any Place to ſtand in, but every <hi>paltry Boy is ready to puſh him down,</hi> &amp;c. Thus likewiſe thoſe Ill-bred and Miſtaught Children did petulantly deride that Old Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> yelling out thoſe impudent words, [<hi>go up thou Bald-pate,</hi> &amp;c.] 2 Kings 2.23. Having nothing worſe to upbraid him with, they taunt that Head with their Scorns, which God had crowned with Honour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.31. And the ſame God who had thus honoured his Servant <hi>Eliſha,</hi> doth likewiſe vindicate this diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour caſt upon him, ordering <hi>two She Bears</hi> (poſſibly robb'd of their Whelps) to worry <hi>forty and two</hi> of thoſe Ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd Children: As their Childhood did not excuſe them, ſo their Idolatrous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <pb n="279" facs="tcp:48866:144"/>were puniſhed in being writ Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for giving them no better Education; ſee more of this in my <hi>Third Volume</hi> on this ſame <hi>Hiſtory.</hi> NB.
<hi>Note well,</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any of us <hi>Aged</hi> Ones be at any time derided by Younger ones, this may allay our Grief, that God doth not lead us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any untrodden Path, for our <hi>Betters</hi> have gone before us therein,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Evils,</hi> to wit,
<hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Spiritual,</hi> which do attend <hi>Old Age,</hi> may be put together, and briefly improved. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1<hi>ſt</hi>) The <hi>Moral Evils</hi> are, (1.) An
<hi>over-eagerneſs</hi> in a greedy ſeeking of Wealth, and yet a niggardly unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſpend what is gotten; no not ſometimes to ſupply the Neceſſities of Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) A <hi>dull,</hi> ſlow and cold pace in all proceedings of Buſineſs, yea with a timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and fearful temper of Mind, and yet fretting and chafing at the ſame dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and backwardneſs that he beholds in others under him.</p>
            <p>(3.) The <hi>Old Man</hi> is of a <hi>moroſe</hi> Mind, hard to be pleaſed himſelf, and as hard to pleaſe others; a froward Spirit is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſpleaſed, (as we ſee in Babes at the Breaſt.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet are not ſo eaſily pleaſed again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:48866:145"/>(4.) Another <hi>Moral Evil</hi> in the Aged is, to complain of <hi>preſent Times,</hi> but praiſing <hi>former Days</hi> of old, which the Old Men of thoſe Days did as much complain of, as
<hi>he</hi> doth of <hi>theſe:</hi> Whereas indeed the fault <hi>lieth</hi> not in the <hi>Times,</hi> (either preſent, or former,) but in the
<hi>Perſons</hi> that <hi>liveth</hi> in thoſe Times, for in every Age, better Hearts and Lives would make better Times.</p>
            <p n="2">Then (2<hi>dly</hi>) After theſe <hi>Moral Vices</hi> do follow <hi>Spiritual Sins,</hi> which are found in Old Age, ſuch as (1.)
<hi>Ignorance,</hi> a meer Child for knowledge, no Fool like to an Old Fool; and therefore tho' this <hi>ſilly Child</hi> be an <hi>hundred Years</hi> old, he is denounced by a Divine Mouth to be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed,</hi> Iſai.
65.20. Thus the Old Age of that ſilly Child <hi>Shimei,</hi> (who childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plaid away his own Life) could not exempt him from Juſtice; for it was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s charge to his Son <hi>Solomon,</hi> [<hi>let not his Hoary Head go down to the Grave in peace,</hi>] 1 Kings 2.6.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) An <hi>indocible, untractable Frame</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<hi>Old Age</hi> to learn the great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Godlineſs, as appeared in
<hi>Old Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus,</hi> tho' a <hi>Maſter in Iſrael,</hi> and could not but have read of a <hi>New Heart,</hi> which God promiſed to give,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and in other places of the
<hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> yet how <hi>aukward</hi> was<pb n="281" facs="tcp:48866:145"/>he in entertaining the Doctrine of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, objecting againſt it;
<hi>Firſt,</hi> [<hi>How can a Man be born again?</hi>] And after
<hi>Chriſt</hi> had told him, that the way of the <hi>Spirits working</hi> this work, was <hi>incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,</hi> &amp;c. yet comes he off again with his (<hi>How can theſe things be?</hi>] John 3.4,10. This <hi>Old Man,</hi> (nay an Old <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> in teaching work) underſtood no more of the Myſtery of the New Birth, than a <hi>rude Ruſtick</hi> can comprehend the profoundeſt Points of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> which be no better than <hi>Gibberiſh</hi> to him when he hears them: <hi>NB.</hi> However it is no matter how dull the Scholar is, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf will become the Teacher, as here; for this <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who had long been a Night-bird, during the Life of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did at the laſt break forth as the Sun from under a Cloud, to manifeſt his Love to his Lord after his Death, <hi>John</hi> 19.39.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) To illuſtrate this farther, <hi>Old Age</hi> is
<hi>Self-conceited,</hi> and cannot eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, through Pride of Spirit rooted in it, he is too wiſe to learn, therefore was it that
<hi>Solomon</hi> preferred [a <hi>poor and wiſe Child,</hi> before an <hi>Old and Fooliſh King,</hi> who abhors <hi>to be admoniſhed,</hi>] Eccleſ.
4.13,14. for the <hi>Young Child</hi> is apt to learn, and ready to receive Inſtruction, and will be as careful to follow it; and all this
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48866:146"/>is <hi>true Wiſdom:</hi> Whereas an <hi>Old</hi> and
<hi>Fooliſh King</hi> is not only <hi>weak,</hi> but alſo <hi>wilful,</hi> and his Pride is the ground of his Wilfulneſs; as he is ſhort-ſighted in his Mind, ſo he is ſtubborn and unconvinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his Will: There have been ſuch Kings in the World, who in their Old Age, have ſhewed themſelves ſo ſelf-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſo wedded to their own vain Opinions, that they never endured to ask Advice, and if any were given them, what they fancied not, they aſſuredly rejected it; though they ſometimes, yea very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ask Counſel, yet never follow any but their <hi>own,</hi> until they ruin themſelves and their People.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) As the <hi>Three</hi> former brings Ruine,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the <hi>Bodies,</hi> not only of <hi>Old and Fooliſh Kings,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Old and Fooliſh Subjects,</hi> who do harden their Hearts againſt all good Counſel; yea, and that which is worſt of all, theſe <hi>Three</hi> afore-named, bring deſtruction to their
<hi>Souls</hi> likewiſe, by their living and dying in that great ſin of
<hi>Unbelief,</hi> and <hi>final Impenitency,</hi> which their <hi>cuſtom in ſin</hi> (taking away all <hi>conſcience of ſin</hi>) doth at laſt ſeal them up in, where the ſuperabounding Grace of God doth not interpoſe to diſappoint it. This refracto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and untoward, untractable Temper of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:48866:146"/>abhorring to be taught, hath been a long time obſerved, univerſally to accompany <hi>Old Age;</hi> inſomuch that this was the firſt ground of that <hi>Old</hi> Greek <hi>Adage,</hi> [<hi>

                  </gap>,</hi>] <hi>Senum Doctor,</hi> a Teacher of Old Perſons; by which <hi>Phraſe</hi> the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Ancients uſed to expreſs any <hi>labour in vain,</hi> like thoſe other Phraſes, [<hi>Aethiopem lavare</hi>] to <hi>waſh a Blackmore white,</hi> which Phraſe is uſed in Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. And to the ſame purpoſe is that <hi>Adage</hi> uſed by Pagan Authors, [<hi>Syſiphi ſaxum voluere,</hi>] a Poetical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that this <hi>Syſiphus</hi> was doomed unto as a puniſhment for his former Faults, that he was to roll an heavy Stone up the Hill, which then did run down again of it ſelf with its own weight; and when it came to the bottom, his work was to roll it up again; yea, and that which was the Miſchief and Miſery of this Man in this Work, it muſt be his only and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Task for all his time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe <hi>Adages</hi> do demonſtrate the unteachable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Old Age,</hi> and that if we do not (through the Grace of God) <hi>remember our Creator in the days of our Youth,</hi> while that tractable Temper continueth with us, but ſtill drive it off until Old, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come we ſo ſlow, ſo oblivious, and ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the Lees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> inſomuch that the <pb n="284" facs="tcp:48866:147"/>Miniſtry of the Word (that they ſit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) is
<hi>labour in vain</hi> to ſuch, and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Miniſters may complain with the <hi>Prophet,</hi> (as to ſuch as <hi>hate to be reformed,</hi> and are incorrigible,) [<hi>I have laboured in vain, and I have ſpent my ſtrength for naught, and in vain,</hi>] Iſai. 49.4. <hi>NB. Note well,</hi> how beſotted, and even bewitched are ſuch Perſons, to make that the Task of their Old Age, which ought to be the Trade of our whole Life, and to ſettle their everlaſting, and ſureſt making or marring upon ſo ſandy and ſinking a Foundation, as <hi>Old Age</hi> is, well called an
<hi>Evil Age,</hi> for Reaſons aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Now the next and <hi>Second Point</hi> to be diſcourſed upon is, How this <hi>Evil Old Age,</hi> may become a <hi>Good Old Age,</hi> as was
<hi>Abrahams,</hi> Gen. 25.8. and <hi>Iſaac's,</hi> Gen. 35.29. and

<hi>ſcraped</hi> off from the Walls of our Earthly Tabernacles, until the Houſe, that is infected with that <hi>Plague,</hi> be demoliſhed by Death, and the <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Timber</hi> thereof be altogether taken down: As it was thus in the <hi>Type</hi> under the Law concerning the <hi>Houſe of Leproſie,</hi> Levit. 14.43,44. So it is with our <hi>Houſes of Clay</hi> as the <hi>Antitype,</hi> which can no way be <hi>Amended,</hi> but muſt be
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;</hi> and this is only done in part while we are in the

               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:48866:160"/>the <hi>Aged,</hi> Phil. <hi>v.</hi> 9. was not only a

15.55. This is the boldeſt, and the braveſt Challenge, that ever any Mortal Man did ring in the Ears of <hi>Death,</hi> in which words he (as it were) out-braved it, calling it <hi>Craven</hi> to its Face, as the Vulgar ſaying is, and bids it do its worſt to him that it could do, like the
<hi>Philoſopher Anaxarchus,</hi> who with an undaunted Courage told the
<hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> (who was beating his Body to pieces with a great Iron Peſtle in a large Mortar, made purpoſely for that Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Butchery,) in the very Act of his Martyrdom, he moſt confidently cryed out to his Tormentor, <hi>Tunde, Tunde Tyranne, Vaſculum frangis, ſed Anaxarchum non Laedis,</hi>] <hi>Beat on, beat on thou Bruitiſh Tyrant,</hi> thou indeed doth break the <hi>Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> of the <hi>Man,</hi> but thou can never hurt <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the <hi>Man himſelf.</hi> Much more might this bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle</hi> inſult over this greateſt of Tyrants, that univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of Mankind, to wit, <hi>Death</hi> with his
<hi>Javelin</hi> in his hand, ſeeing he was ſo able as to render ſuch weighty Reaſons<pb n="312" facs="tcp:48866:161"/>for his Triumphing Inſultation as he ſaith, [the Sting of Death is Sin, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 56. ſignifying hereby, that our <hi>dear Redeemer</hi> had been the <hi>Death</hi> of

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, namely, the
<hi>Dues</hi> that are the Due Homage and Divine Debt which God commands all Mankind to pay unto Old Age. As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) In <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32. (which hath been ſpoken to before,) where God's Charge runs in this Senſe, [<hi>Do thou Honour the Face of the Old Man, if thou feareſt God, who will ſurely puniſh thee, if thou doſt it not.</hi>] And,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) God took it heinouſly at the Hands of the King of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> ſaying to him, [<hi>Upon the Ancients haſt thou very heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid thy Yoke, and ſhewed them no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>] Iſai. 47.6.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) God did reckon it as a great and grievous Crime to have the <hi>Aged</hi> and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ones <hi>deſpiſed</hi> by the
<hi>Younger</hi> Sort, and therefore he threatens this as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to the ſtubborn <hi>Jews,</hi> [that <hi>the Child ſhall behave himſelf proudly againſt the Ancient,</hi>] Iſai. 3.5. Such ſins as are threatned for puniſhments, are uſually great ſins; and had not the ſawcy Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Children towards the Aged, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially towards their own Aged Parents,)<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48866:166"/>been a notorious injury unto Old Perſons; it would never have been threatned as a <hi>Curſe</hi> and
<hi>Puniſhment.</hi> If it were a great <hi>wrong,</hi> it was alſo a great
<hi>ſin;</hi> and if it were a great <hi>ſin,</hi> it muſt expect a great
<hi>Plague</hi> and Puniſhment. Many more Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures might here be added, with a ſhort deſcant upon them; but to be ſhort, this brief following Reference ſhall ſuffiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">As, (4) <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.29.</p>

            <p>(<hi>Laſtly,</hi>) 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1,2. All which Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do plainly hold forth, what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and Reverence ought to be given, and is commanded by the great God to be given unto Aged Perſons, even in thoſe Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt times of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtaments,</hi> and how can we learn to write after a more perfect Pattern, and a more infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Copy. Yea, and upon a brief ſearch of the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of the Church, ſoon after thoſe pure Scripture times, I do find this grave and ſolid Teſtimony concerning this very Point of the Honour of Old Age, in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> his Book, called <hi>Paedagogus,</hi> written in the Year of our Lord, 194<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who in his <hi>Third Book</hi> of that before-named Title, ſpeaks thus, [<hi>Non eſt malum Senem videri, cum hoc<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48866:166"/>quod ſis, celare non poſſis: Quo ergo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis Homo feſtinat ad finem, tanto eſt vere Venerabilior, ut qui Deum ſolum habeat ſe Seniorem, nam ille quoque eſt Aeternus S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

2.1.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Duty</hi> is, That we ſhould make good proof of our Graces, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of that Foundation-grace of <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto Life,</hi> as it is called <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. (<hi>granted</hi> unto us
<hi>Gentiles,</hi>) for where right <hi>Repentance towards God</hi> is given,
'tis always accompanied with <hi>faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Acts 20.21. This Grace of <hi>Repentance</hi> is ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſary, that both our Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his Forerunner, <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Baptiſt,</hi> began their Miniſtry with this indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Doctrine, [<hi>Repent,</hi> for the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand,</hi>] Matth. 3.2. and 4.17. and Mark 1.15. Join <hi>Repent and Believe</hi> both together. Now ſeeing the <hi>Tree is known by its Fruit, whether it be good or bad,</hi> Matth. 12.33. Luke 6.44. If we be no better than Bramble-Buſhes, no Grapes of Grace can grow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us; but if we be <hi>Trees of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the Lord's <hi>planting</hi> and <hi>water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as Iſai. 61.3. then ſhall we <hi>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> Matth.<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48866:169"/>3.8. Now the true Notion and Nature of this Grace of <hi>Repentance</hi> is, our <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> from
<hi>Darkneſs</hi> to <hi>Light,</hi> Acts 26.18. and our returning from the faln Eſtate by the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> into a renewed Eſtate by the
<hi>Second Adam:</hi> As we are all <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Trees. Ariſtotle</hi> calls Man <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor inverſa,</hi> a Tree turned upward, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Head as Root, and the Arms and Legs the Branches of this Tree, <hi>&amp;c. Bernard</hi> calls Man [<hi>Inverſus Decalogus,</hi>] as quite contrary to God's Law, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt he be turned up-ſide down, as the Picture of the Horſe, and then right, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have our <hi>Standing Time</hi> in our
<hi>Life,</hi> and we muſt have our <hi>Falling Time</hi> at our
<hi>Death;</hi> the <hi>Ax whereof</hi> is laid to the Root of us in thoſe manifold Diſtempers which attend Old Age, as if God were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his Aim where to cut us up, and how to hew us down, Matth. 3.10. Now as all Trees, be they ſtrong <hi>Oakes,</hi> or lofty <hi>Cedars,</hi> muſt have their time of falling; ſo all Mankind, be they of never ſo robuſt a Conſtitution, and be they of never ſo high, either of <hi>State</hi> or of
<hi>Stature,</hi> muſt have a time of dying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. and as Trees, what way they moſtly <hi>lean,</hi> that way they uſually fall, whether it be <hi>Southward</hi> or <hi>Northward,</hi> Eccleſ. 11.3. So we ought to examine our ſelves, which<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48866:169"/>way our
<hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> do lean, whether <hi>Southward</hi> towards the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mal. 4.2. As 'tis record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (who <hi>walked with God</hi>) [that his
<hi>Journyings</hi> were ſtill <hi>towards</hi> the <hi>South,</hi>] towards the Sun, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.9. So all the Sons and Daughters of
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſhould hang Heavenward, and ſhould lean
<hi>Southward;</hi> then may there be good grounds of a <hi>lively Hope,</hi> that when we die, we ſhall fall upon the <hi>Right-hand of Chriſt,</hi> among the <hi>fruitful Sheep,</hi> and ſhall hear thoſe comfortable words,
[<hi>Come, ye bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c.] Matth. 25.33,34. But if on the other hand we do not find, that we have with <hi>David,</hi>
[<hi>conſidered our former evil ways,</hi> and <hi>turned our Feet</hi> (our
<hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>) towards God's Teſtimonies,] Pſal. 119.59. If yet we are not returned to God by <hi>Repentance,</hi> but are ſtill journy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the <hi>North,</hi> towards that cold Country, where there is
<hi>weeping and wail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and gnaſhing of Teeth for cold, (tho' it be a
<hi>fiery Furnace for heat,</hi>] Matth. 13.42,50. If we lean
<hi>Northward,</hi> and <hi>hang Hellward,</hi> we ſhall ſurely
<hi>fall</hi> upon the <hi>Left Hand</hi> of the <hi>Judge</hi> among the

25.41. As the Tree, where it falls, <pb n="330" facs="tcp:48866:170"/>
               <hi>Northward</hi> or
<hi>Southward,</hi> there it lies, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.3. even ſo where we fall at our Deaths, whether <hi>Northward,</hi> upon the Left Hand of our Judge; or <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> upon the Right Hand of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, there we ſhall lie until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection-day; for <hi>after Death comes the Day of Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. Then all both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> ſhall riſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third Duty</hi> of us <hi>Aged Ones</hi> is, Not to dally or delay that weighty Work of making our Peace with God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Divine Counſel, [<hi>Acquaint now thy ſelf with God, and be at Peace with him, and thereby good ſhall come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee,</hi>] Job 22.21. This great Duty muſt be <hi>now</hi> done, we have been aſleep, or Strangers to God long enough, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.12. and 4.18. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.2. There be
<hi>Times of Grace,</hi> while the Word of the Goſpel is preached to us; and there be <hi>Seaſons of Grace,</hi> when the Spirit of God goeth along with God's Word, and <hi>convinceth of ſin,</hi> &amp;c. John 16.8. Now ſuch a
<hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is the moſt beautiful part of time, and [how <hi>can we eſcape if we neglect ſo great ſalvation!</hi>] Heb. 2.3. This is a
<hi>quenching the Spirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.19. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities are Headlong, and once loſt<pb n="331" facs="tcp:48866:170"/>and paſt, may never be recovered. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth God in Scripture ſo earneſtly preſs upon this [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] this <hi>Now</hi> or Time preſent, becauſe ſo many perſons are [<hi>Semper Victuri,</hi>] as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, they promiſe to themſelves, that they ſhall yet live a little longer, ſaying, [<hi>in Space will come Grace;</hi>] ſo they trifle out their Time, and puts off the making of their Peace with God for the <hi>future,</hi> and
<hi>future</hi> their Duty ſo long, until at laſt they fool away their own Salvation; whereas delays are dangerous, <hi>qui non eſt hodie, cras minus aptus erit,</hi> he that is not fit to day, will be leſs fit to morrow; as the hinder Wheels of a Coach do pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the former Wheels thereof all the day long, and tho' they be much larger than the other, and but at a very ſmall diſtance (of a yard or two) from them, yet they never overtake them: Even ſo it is in this caſe, <hi>one delay</hi> (of making our Peace with God) doth beget another from day to day, and the latter Promiſe of Repenting purſues the former from time to time, but never overtakes it; [<hi>Poſt eſt Occaſio Calva, Time</hi> hath no Lock behind its Head for us to take hold of, whereby the hinder and the former part thereof may be made to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48866:171"/>And know, God will not always ſerve Men for a Sinning-ſtock from time to time; and as Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> well obſerveth, that in theſe <hi>Times of Grace,</hi> the Lord is more
<hi>quick</hi> and <hi>Peremptory</hi> in rejecting of ſuch as dally with the Tenders of Peace: God's time of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is ſhorter now, he will not wait ſo long, as he was wont to do, he will not ſuffer us to neglect it twice; but if once paſt, it will never dawn again. 'Tis true, [the
<hi>long-ſuffering</hi> of <hi>God is Salvation,</hi>] Rom. 2.4. and 2 Pet.
3.15. but [<hi>laeſa patientia fit furor,</hi>] if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to abuſe God's Patience, then it turns into Fury, and we are but <hi>treaſuring up to our ſelves wrath, againſt the day of wrath,</hi> Rom. 2.5. and therefore we ought to catch at preſent Opportunities; as <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> and
<hi>Mariners</hi> do catch at preſent <hi>Gales,</hi> and make uſe of them when they come; and as <hi>Watermen</hi> take the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the
<hi>Tide,</hi> all well-knowing, that neither <hi>Wind,</hi> nor <hi>Tide,</hi> nor <hi>Time</hi> will ſtay no Man's Leiſure or Pleaſure; they all are in
<hi>God's fiſt,</hi> Prov. 30.4. (who hath alone the Royalty of theſe his Creatures,) and not in the power of <hi>Man:</hi> We ought therefore to catch at the <hi>Seaſon</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> as we hear the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho</hi> doth at the <hi>Voice,</hi> loudly ſpoken in<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48866:171"/>Places of Reverberation, even in the very nick of Time. Thus we find <hi>David</hi> did,
[<hi>no ſooner had he heard God ſpeaking,</hi> [<hi>ſeek ye my Face,</hi>] <hi>but</hi> immediately <hi>his Heart</hi> (being inſpired by the Spirit to a gracious compliance,) did (as it were) <hi>eccho</hi> back again, [<hi>thy Face, Lord, will I ſeek,</hi>] Pſal. 27.8. And the like
<hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho,</hi> or quick Anſwer we find in the <hi>Church</hi> to her
<hi>Lord,</hi> who no ſooner had ſaid to her [<hi>Return, ye back-ſliding Children, and I will heal your backſlidings;</hi> She pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently Anſwers,
[<hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God,</hi>] Jer. 3.22. The <hi>Church</hi> was thus moved to yield her ready Obedience unto her Lord's Command, becauſe [<hi>the power of the Lord was preſent to heal her,</hi>] as <hi>Luke</hi> 5.17. And indeed every godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath, as it were, the
<hi>duplicate</hi> and <hi>counter-part</hi> of <hi>God's Law</hi> written in his Heart, and is willingly caſt into the Mold of his Word, as <hi>Rom.</hi>
6.17. may be read, to wit, [<hi>ye have obeyed from the heart,</hi> that Form, (<hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Mold</hi>) <hi>of Doctrine into which ye were caſt.</hi>] The Doctrine of the Goſpel is the <hi>Mold,</hi> and the Hearts of Hearers is the Mettal, which when ſufficiently melted in the Furnace, being purged from the Droſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is then pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the Mold, and willingly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth <pb n="334" facs="tcp:48866:172"/>that <hi>Form</hi> and
<hi>Figure</hi> of that <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Veſſel</hi> that it is caſt into, taking Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion from it in one part as well as another, and receives its Form in the whole. Oh that it may be ſo with us, to <hi>acquaint now our ſelves with God,</hi> while he calls us, and be at <hi>peace with him:</hi> This is done, if we return to God ſpeedily by Repentance from whom we have ſo ſhamefully <hi>revolted,</hi> and againſt whom we have ſo notoriouſly <hi>rebelled;</hi> our <hi>Lord</hi> calleth loudly upon us, duly and daily, [<hi>To day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts,</hi>] Pſal. 95.7,8. Heb. 3.7,8. as in the <hi>day of Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> It muſt be <hi>done to day,</hi> while the <hi>Gales</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> continue blowing and breathing; 'tis the Cry of that unclean Bird, the Crow, [<hi>Cras, Cras,</hi>] that is, to <hi>Morrow,</hi> to
<hi>Morrow</hi> will be ſoon enough. If we harden our own Hearts by Unbelief, as our <hi>choice</hi> to day, God may lay Hardneſs of Heart upon us, as our Judgment to <hi>morrow;</hi> ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> nor
<hi>Miſery,</hi> nor <hi>Miracle,</hi> nor <hi>Mercy</hi> may poſſibly
<hi>Mollifie</hi> them.</p>
            <p>But on the other hand, if the Lord move our Hearts, to make ſuch a <hi>quick Eccho,</hi> and gracious Anſwer to God's Call and Command, as
<hi>Samuel</hi> did by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Good Old <hi>Eli,</hi>

This is a bleſſed evidence, that God hath [<hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Ears,</hi>] and we ſhall ſay then, [<hi>Lo, we come to do thy will, O God,</hi> and we <hi>delight in doing it,</hi>] Pſal. 40.6,7,8.
<hi>Chriſt's people are willing in the day of Chriſt's power,</hi> Pſal.
110.3. they then will <hi>make haſte and not delay,</hi> Pſal. 119.59,60. yea, it ſhould be our <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi> to <hi>do God's Will,</hi> as it was to <hi>our Lord,</hi> Joh. 4.34. Now if we can but find any promptneſs in our Wills and Affections to turn our Hearts from ſin, and return to God <hi>without delays,</hi> we ſhall then <hi>be at peace with him,</hi> and <hi>he with us,</hi> yea, and <hi>thereby good ſhall come unto us,</hi> Job. 22.21. <hi>we ſhall be happy,</hi> and it ſhall be <hi>well with us,</hi> Pſal. 128.2.

To conclude this Point, if <hi>we,</hi> who are <hi>Aged,</hi> have delayed hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to <hi>make our peace with God,</hi> we have burnt Day-light too much already, 'tis high time to uſe expedition.

            <p>The <hi>Fourth Duty</hi> of all Aged Ones is, ſeriouſly to conſider the many weariſom Evils, which <hi>Old Age</hi> is now about to bring upon us, whereof <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth a particular deſcription of, after he had ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Old Age</hi> an <hi>Evil Age</hi> in the general,

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Other <hi>Decays</hi> that attend our

All this diſtinct deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth the <hi>wiſeſt of Men</hi> leave upon Divine Record, that it might the more awaken us to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. <hi>to make our Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. That we all may with all expedition make ſure work for a better World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go hence to be ſeen no more.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Decays</hi> of Old Age, in its <hi>former part,</hi> whilſt as yet we are able to walk abroad; be,</p>

<hi>Candles, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Darkneſs</hi> cometh not not from any <hi>Decay</hi> of thoſe Lights, but from the <hi>Dimneſs</hi> of our own Sight; hence cometh our need of Spectacles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It implies alſo, that all the <hi>comforts</hi> and and contentments which we formerly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in our Younger Years, are now turned into <hi>Diſcomforts,</hi> into Diſeaſes, Aches and Pains, which darken greater and leſſer Comforts.

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> If God bleſs us to live up to Old Age, we ought not to complain of it, for 'tis a <hi>bleſſing</hi> we muſt bleſs God for,
[<hi>Length of days is from the Right Hand, Riches and Honour from the Left,</hi> Prov. 3.16. And God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48866:184"/>to his
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> after its Reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, [that there ſhould <hi>be Old Men and Old Women in the Streets of it, with Staves in their Hands,</hi>] Zech.
8.4. yea and it was <hi>God's Curſe</hi> upon the Houſe of <hi>Ely,</hi>
[that <hi>not any that were Old ſhould be found in it,</hi>] 1 Sam. 2.32. Therefore if God do ſtill preſerve the rotten Thread of our Lives, and draw it out to laſt ſo long, and yet the Clue have a little more Yarn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Botton; Oh how thankfully ought we to <hi>welcome</hi> this Gueſt of Gods own ſending, and not to complain of it as our great Burden, but entertain it chearfully with God-praiſing hearts! 'Tis true, tho' <hi>Old Age</hi> be a rich Bleſſing of God in it ſelf, (as is largely demonſtrated before) and yet is called an <hi>Evil Age,</hi> for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons afore-named. Notwithſtanding, <hi>God hath not left it comfortleſs,</hi> as 'tis ſaid,
<hi>John</hi> 14.18. But the <hi>Spirit</hi> (who is the <hi>Comforter,</hi> hath left upon Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord ſo many <hi>Cordials,</hi> as are truly
<hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> againſt all the <hi>Evils</hi> that attend it; inſomuch as <hi>Old Age</hi> may be an <hi>eaſie Age,</hi> a calm and quiet Harbour, if <hi>Youth</hi> hath done it no diſſervice in <hi>filling</hi> its
<hi>bones with</hi> the <hi>ſins of Youth</hi> before-hand; and if Intemperance (which is like the Thief in the Candle, waſting
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48866:185"/>it away) hath not weakned its Head or Feet,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this caſe <hi>Old Age</hi> hath cauſe to complain of the <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>Man,</hi> and not the <hi>Man</hi> to murmure at the <hi>Evils of Old Age.</hi> Thus <hi>Old Job</hi> oft complains of the Miſery of his Old Age, ſaying, [<hi>Lord, thou changeſt our Countenances,</hi> and <hi>ſendeſt us away,</hi>] Job 14.20. and many myriads of <hi>ſuch Sighs,</hi> (too long to relate) do ever and anon iſſue out of his Mouth. And he himſelf tells us, the ground of all his grief was, [<hi>that God made him to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſins of his Youth</hi>] Job 13.26. therefore (ſays he) <hi>thou writeſt bitter things againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. Thus likewiſe <hi>Old David</hi> complained,
[<hi>I am become like a Bottle in the Smoak,</hi>] Pſal. 119.83. and much more in many other <hi>Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. which drove him to groan out that Petition, [<hi>Lord, remember not againſt me the Tranſgreſſions of my Youth,</hi> for <hi>thy tender Mercies have been of old,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal.
25.6,7. Both thoſe <hi>Inſtances</hi> were Holy Perſons, who after thoſe and many more ſuch Complaints, were (both of them) <hi>comforted</hi> by the <hi>God of all Comforts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. and had their <hi>Old Age</hi> marvelouſly ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to them, and had their <hi>beſt Wine

1.16. and ſuch as drive a <hi>Through-Trade</hi> all their Lives in Weaving the Web of Wickedneſs, having been <hi>twice dipped</hi> in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Dye-Tub, (as the Greek word [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Pliny</hi> tells us, [<hi>Serpens, Serpentem devorans, fit Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi>] as that Serpent, which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoureth other Serpents, becomes to be a <hi>Dragon</hi> at laſt: So a long ſwallower of many Sins, becomes at<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48866:186"/>the length a moſt Monſtrous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that Old and true ſaying, [that if Perſons prove not

<hi>Solomon,</hi> [<hi>ſuch as ſeek me early, ſhall find me,</hi>] Prov.
8.17. Whereas the <hi>Habitual Sinner,</hi> (to whom God hath given the

24.13.

Note well,</hi> Our Lord tells <hi>Peter</hi> what <hi>Miſeries</hi> he ſhould
<hi>meet withal</hi> when he <hi>came to be Old,</hi> John 21.18. He had the manner of his Death foretold him, that he ſhould <hi>glorifie</hi> God by Martyrdom, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. and obſerve what an holy Improvement he made of this Precaution; he had made his Solemn Appeal to an All-knowing Lord, ſaying, [<hi>thou knoweſt</hi> all things, <hi>thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi>] ver. 17. and to teſtifie his Love to his Lord in <hi>feeding his Lambs,</hi> he wrote thoſe two famous <hi>Epiſtles General</hi> to the
<hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and in the latter of them he ſaith,
[<hi>I will not be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to put you always in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, <hi>I think it meet, while I am in this Tabernacle,</hi> to ſtir you up,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> knowing that ſhortly I muſt <hi>put off this Tabernacle,</hi> even as our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>ſhewed me,</hi>] 2 Pet. 1.12,13,14,15. He knew <pb n="364" facs="tcp:48866:187"/>that his Tent or Tabernacle muſt ſoon be taken down, his <hi>Earthly Houſe,</hi> (as
<hi>Paul,</hi> who was a <hi>Tent-maker,</hi> calls the <hi>Body</hi> a Tent, 2 Cor. 5.1. So both theſe two great Apoſtles did tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and duly endeavour to
<hi>magnifie,</hi> and to <hi>glorifie Chriſt,</hi> both in Life and at Death, <hi>John</hi> 21.19. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.20.

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Aged</hi> may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that now they are approaching near the end of their troubleſome Voyage, through a dangerous Sea, both of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<hi>Tribulations,</hi> and of many <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations</hi> alſo; yea, and nigh to the end of their Toilſom Travel, and Wandrings in the Wilderneſs of this lower World, and now drawing nigh toward their Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Haven of Eternal Happineſs in Heaven.

<hi>Saints while they are Young,</hi> ought to become <hi>Angels</hi> when they come to be <hi>Old;</hi> for [the <hi>Path of the Juſt</hi> is like a

               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Old Diſciples of Chriſt</hi> may comfort themſelves with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that the Lord loveth his
<hi>Mnaſons,</hi> Acts 21.16. even when they are paſt their work; foraſmuch as they have taken heed to <hi>fulfill their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi> they
<hi>received in the Lord,</hi> Col. 4.17. Hitherto to the beſt of their
<hi>Abilities,</hi> their <hi>Conſciences bearing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> hereto in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 9.1. 2 Cor. 1.12. Acts 23.1. and 24.16. they are ſtill <hi>beloved of God,</hi> for what work they have already wrought
<hi>for his Glory,</hi> and for the good of many Saints; the reflection of this cannot but conduce much to the Comfort of their own Souls: Tho' now they be like Travellers that ride upon Tired Horſes, they can proceed no farther in publick Generation-work, yet they can ſay with <hi>Paul the Aged,</hi> Philem. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. [<hi>to will, is preſent with us,</hi> but how
<hi>to perform, we find not,</hi>] Rom. 7.18. And now their only work is to Ripen<pb facs="tcp:48866:190"/>faſt, and to become fully Mellow to be gathered home,
<hi>&amp;c. NB. Note well,</hi> The Lord's tender loving-kindneſs to the godly <hi>Levites</hi> under the Law, [in <hi>giving</hi> them leave, when Old, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from that Laborious Service of his Sanctuary,] <hi>Numb.</hi>
8.23,24,25. yet were they as <hi>Judges,</hi> &amp;c. all which may comfort us under the Goſpel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Still God commands, [<hi>let the Younger</hi> ſubmit to the <hi>Elder,</hi>] 1 Pet. 5.5. and as <hi>David</hi> was kind to Young <hi>Chimham,</hi> for Old <hi>Barzillai</hi>'s ſake, 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 19.38. So the Lord is kind to the Off-ſpring of his Old Servants, who are Children of many Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus, tho' they be laid aſide, as Old Almanacks, uſeleſs by Men, they are not ſo by their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Cordials</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> that the Lord hath left us upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againſt the <hi>Fear of Death.</hi> If we would get good Gold, we muſt go to <hi>Ophir;</hi> good Balm, we muſt go to <hi>Gilead,</hi> &amp;c. So if we would get good Comfort, we muſt go to the <hi>God of all True Comfort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. and to the <hi>Book</hi> of God, which conſiſts of thoſe <hi>full Breaſts</hi> of
<hi>Conſolation</hi> which we<pb n="372" facs="tcp:48866:191"/>are commanded to
<hi>ſuck and be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> againſt all our Fears, <hi>&amp;c. Iſai.</hi> 66.11. <hi>Job</hi> calls <hi>Death</hi> the <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> chap. 18.14. and ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a <hi>Terror to Kings too;</hi> the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher</hi> calls [<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,] the moſt <hi>formidable</hi> of <hi>Formidables,</hi> and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the beſt doth find it frightful enough; yet our Lord ſaith,
[<hi>I will not leave you Comfortleſs,</hi>] John 14.18.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Firſt Comfort</hi> againſt the <hi>Fear of Death,</hi> and that our Lord hath left us for our Relief, is 1 Cor. 15.55. that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> hath <hi>unſtinged</hi> that <hi>Serpent,</hi> and that now his Redeemed may triumph over it. <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt <hi>fled from</hi> the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> but being better informed, he <hi>took it by the Tail,</hi> and then it became an <hi>Uſeful Rod</hi> in his Hand,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 4.3,4. Thus <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt fled from
<hi>Goliah,</hi> as affrighted with the ſight of ſuch a Monſter of Mankind, but ſo ſoon as they underſtood that <hi>David</hi> had ſlain him, and laid him along without his Head upon the ground, then did they run as faſt to him to trample upon him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore run away from him ſore affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<pb n="373" facs="tcp:48866:191"/>1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
17.24,52. So could we but believe that <hi>Chriſt, our Lord David</hi> had
<hi>ſwallowed up Death in Victory,</hi> (as we are aſſured,
<hi>Iſai.</hi> 25.8. and that <hi>Chriſt's Death</hi> is the <hi>Death of Death, Hoſ.</hi> 13.14.) then might we ſing a Triumphant Song (with the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi>) over both <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Grave,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Second Breaſt</hi> of <hi>Comfort</hi> againſt the
<hi>Fear of Death</hi> is, that precious Promiſe of God, [<hi>Thou ſhalt not be afraid, when Deſtruction or Death com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>] Job 5.21. and thus God ſaid to Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> [<hi>fear not to go down to Egypt, for I will be with thee, and I will bring thee back again,</hi> &amp;c.] Gen. 46.3,4. Accordingly our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith to his <hi>ſanctified ones,</hi> Iſai. 13.3. [<hi>Fear not to go down among the Dead,</hi> (which is <hi>a going the way of all the Earth,</hi> Joſh. 23.14.) for I will <hi>go down with thee,</hi> and I will aſſuredly alſo <hi>bring thee back again,</hi> as <hi>one</hi> of my <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> Luke
20.36.] as if he had ſaid [<hi>I will</hi> bring you without failure from the
<hi>Jaws of Death</hi> to the <hi>Joys of Heaven,</hi> as ſurely as
<hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> brought all the <hi>Captive Jews</hi> out of the <hi>Captivity of<pb n="374" facs="tcp:48866:192"/>Babylon;</hi> and we muſt conſider for our Comfort, that Death ſeizeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Body</hi> only, which we derive from the <hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs</hi> ſeized only upon <hi>Joſeph's Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> his Perſon eſcaped; ſo the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Soul is returned to God that gave it,</hi> Eccleſ. 12.7.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Third Breaſt of Conſolation</hi> for Saints to
<hi>ſuck</hi> againſt the <hi>Fear of Death</hi> is, [the <hi>Righteous hath Hope in his Death,</hi>] Prov. 14.32. Death to a Believer is as the
<hi>Vally of Achor,</hi> Joſh. 7.24,27. <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land of Promiſe, a <hi>Door of Hope,</hi> Hoſ. 2.15. into the
<hi>Heavenly Canaan,</hi> there to <hi>ſing Hallelujah's</hi> to the Lord for ever. <hi>Death</hi> indeed to <hi>Sinners</hi> is but a <hi>Trap-door</hi> that drops them down into Hell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.17. When that Grim-Sergeant Arreſts them, (by God's <hi>Permiſſion</hi> and <hi>Commiſſion,</hi>) in the <hi>Devil's Name,</hi> and hurls them into an Infinite Ocean of Hell-fire, Oh what Dreadful Skreaks doth that Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Soul give when it is hurried away and hurled into <hi>Everlaſting Burnings</hi> Iſai. 33.14. and to ſwim naked as i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh, how wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling was Old <hi>Jacob</hi> to go down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when it was only to ſee his <hi>youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Son Joſeph,</hi> whom he had not ſeen for many years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How much more <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> yea
<hi>deſirous</hi> ought we to be to <hi>go up to Heaven,</hi> a far better place than <hi>Egypt</hi>) there to ſee our <hi>Elder Brother Jeſus Chriſt!</hi> How glad were thoſe <hi>Three Wiſe Men</hi> of the
<hi>Eaſt</hi> to take a long Journey, when it was only to ſee the <hi>Babe of Bethlehem, Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Cradle,</hi> &amp;c! Now if we can but ſay as thoſe <hi>Wiſe Men</hi> ſaid, [<hi>We have ſeen his Star,</hi> &amp;c. Matth. 2.2,11.] how much more ought we to long for this Journey,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we may behold our Lord <hi>Chriſt advanced</hi> upon the <hi>Throne</hi> of his <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>to behold his Face in Righteouſneſs,</hi> Pſal. 17.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:48866:193"/>which is a <hi>Beatifical Viſion;</hi> a Sight far exceeding thoſe Three, [<hi>Romam in Flore, Paulum in Ore, &amp; Chriſtum in Carne,</hi>] which Father <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly wiſhed to ſee, namely, <hi>Rome</hi> in its <hi>Glory, Paul</hi> in the

3.2. It was a good Prayer of the ſame <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> ſaying,
[<hi>Lord, can no Man ſee thy Face, and live?</hi> O then let me die,
<hi>that I may ſee it,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fourth Cordial</hi> againſt the <hi>Fear of Death</hi> is,
[<hi>Better is the day of our Death,</hi> than the <hi>day of our Birth,</hi>] Eccleſ. 7.12. 'Tis better every way: For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Our <hi>Birth</hi> begins our Miſeries, but our
<hi>Death</hi> ends them; <hi>if we die in the Lord,</hi> we are bleſſed,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. Whereas <hi>Man born of a Woman, is born to trouble,</hi> &amp;c. Job 14.1.

<hi>Chriſt</hi> is our entrance into the beſt and bleſſed World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:48866:193"/>(2.) We come crying into this World,

            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Fifth Cordial</hi> is, that <hi>Death cannot ſeparate us from</hi> the Love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. 'Tis ſo far from deſtroying the <hi>Union,</hi> that it is called a <hi>ſleeping in Jeſus,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.14. And as by <hi>ſleep</hi> the <hi>frame of the Body</hi> is
